            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He World, happily, will conceive, that Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages ſo Noble and Eminent for Place and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, are much too High to be ſolicited to undertake for, or be God-Fathers to a Childe of ſo mean a Birth and quality, as is this that now preſents it ſelf unto Your Excellencies for that purpoſe. Every one will be ready to ſay, that I, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king choice of Your Honourable Names, for Protection of this Treatiſe, have erected too ſtately, and auguſtuous a Portall, for ſo low and mean a Building, as mine is: It may not be denied, but that ſuch a conſtruction may very juſtly be made of my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, if either the Authors inferior quality and condition, or the frame and ſtructure of his work ſhould be ſtrictly eyed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. But on the other ſide, if the matter and end of it, be well taken into conſideration, ſcarce any man can think other, then that it is moſt worthy Your Patronage; as that, that hath no other aime, ſave only the glory of God, the Edification of the Church, the Vindication of the Truth, againſt the illuſions of Sectaries and Noveliſts, and the reduction to the boſome of the Church, of ſuch as are ſtrayed from it. Now, what can there be more ſutable, and fitting for Children, and Servants of the great God, ſuch as as You are, then that which makes for the advancement of his Glory? What can there be more proper for ſuch as are Members, yea Nurſing-Fathers of the Church, then that which tends to the gathering and Uniting together of the Members of
<pb facs="tcp:121103:3"/>her Body? What can there be more worthy ſuch Eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, profeſſing the true Religion, then that which is for the defence of the truth of ſuch opinions as are Orthodox? What can there be more correſponding with the duty of Chiſtian Magiſtrates, then to that which is intended for the reduction of ſuch as are ſtrayed to the Sheepfold of the great Shepherd of our Souls, and that They ſhould aſſiſt the Work by their Politicall Authority, whilſt the Church contributes (which is all ſhe can do) her beſt Reaſons for their conviction. I have further Grounds and Motives for the Dedication of this Treatiſe to Your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: to wit, For that You repreſent here the Perſons of the High and Mighty States of the United Provinces; ſome of whoſe Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and Eſtates are infected with this Venome: Howbeit, God be thanked, it gaines not ground ſo faſt there as here, nor the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green proves hitherto ſo dangerous: Concerns it not us therefore, being infeſted with the ſame Malady, and Diſeaſe, the one as the other, that we ſhould teſtifie our mutuall ſenſe and apprehenſion thereof; and that we ſhould make it appear to all the World, that however we are divided in Body, we are yet notwithſtanding ſtrongly united in Heart; as alſo in an Harmony of Opinions: You labour likewiſe, how You may Eſtabliſh here a Peace, both in Church and State; and this Treatiſe is a good Means, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the former of theſe: You endevour to procure a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell; and this Treatiſe maintaines the equity, and proves the neceſſity of it.</p>
            <p>But yet there is one Reaſon more which more particularly obliges me to preſent this Treatiſe to Your Excellencies; and it is ſuch as I may not at any hand paſſe over, without incurring the Crime of higheſt Ingratitude: Which is, Moſt Excellent Lords, That great Honour Your Famous Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> the very <hi>Athens</hi> of our Age, hath put upon me, in vouchſafing me ſo honorable a Call to be one of its Members; Truly to this Head give me leave to ſay, I cannot ſufficiently admire Your great love to good Letters, and Your unparallel'd care for the advancing of them; ſo as it ſeems, that in Your Provinces, and in them alone they flouriſh and ſhew themſelves in their perfect Luſtre and Beauty. For this purpoſe
<pb facs="tcp:121103:3"/>You from time to time, make choice and Election of the moſt Famous men of all <hi>Europe</hi>) Notwithſtanding, that You have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry able men of your own) as though You meant to gather into one Place all the moſt radiant Stars in the Firmament; ſo as You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil all other Kingdoms of the faireſt flowers of their Crowns, and with a kinde of ſweet violence do, as it were, draw their Eyes out of their Heads, and ſo quite darken and eclipſe their Luſtre and ſhine. I ſay not this, that I would be thought to rank my ſelf in the number of thoſe Great and Eminent Perſonages: I know well, that there are ſome Stars that ſhine by their own light; That there are others again that ſhew not themſelves, but by a borrowed light: But I will not enlarge my diſcourſe upon Your Praiſes, nor undertake to deſcribe at large Your Heroick Vertues; for this is not the place for it; and it hath already been done by far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pens then mine is; I ſhould by ſuch an untertaking fear to ſully the brightneſſe of their Luſtre, and to draw a cloud o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Orient and vivid Colours; And if I ſhould go about it, I ſhould at the ſame time reſolve, to imitate that Excellent Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who, when he had done all that his Art enabled him to do, for the drawing of an exquiſite Pourtaicture, and had ſet out its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the moſt lively colours he could deviſe, drew a curtain over it, miſtruſting the goodneſſe of his Workmanſhip, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating thereby, that there was much more to be conceived of the Peece, then he was able to expreſſe.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, I cannot tell how to contain my ſelf, but I muſt take notice of Your great Actions, and Your many Noble Atchievements by Arms: How You were They, that firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd Your ſelves to the Tyranny of the proud Spanyard; and that firſt of all others, ſtayed the violent courſe of his Conqueſts, that like an impetuous Torrent, was wont to bear down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: So as from a very meane and low beginning, of a ſuddain He was become ſo exceſſively great by poſſeſſing himſelf of the moſt commodious and conſiderable Eſtates of the World, as that he was come to reckon his Crowns by Hundreds, and Thouſands. Yet You, that were but the leaſt part of His E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and that were accompted no better then Beggars &amp; Gueux,
<pb facs="tcp:121103:4"/>in compariſon of thoſe vaſt Treaſures that He drew from <hi>Peru;</hi> You I ſay, were They that firſt blunted the edge of His Conqueſts, and knapt in ſunder the Bonds wherewith he would have enſlav'd You, ſetting Free, and at Liberty together with Your ſelves multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, of others whom He out of an inſatiable Appetite, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to ſet limits or bounds to his over-ſwelling Ambition, had fully purpoſed to make his Vaſſalls. Moreover, You conſtrained him, though much againſt ſtomack, to acknowledge You for Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, &amp; ſuch as depended not at all upon upon His Jurisdiction. And not contenting Your ſelves with all this, You went and found him out in his own Hereditary Eſtates, and purſued Him with fire and ſword, even to his own doores. Yea, You Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed God knows how many Seas, as wel towards the Eaſt, as the Weſt, ſetting at liberty thoſe poor Barbarians, over whoſe Bodies he exerciſed ſo many cruell and new deviſed Tyrannies; and all this under the pretext of a falſe Donation by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And as if You had not an Adverſary at home, that would cut You out buſineſſe enough, nor an Object ſufficient to entertain You, You ſet Your ſelves on work to diſcover ſeverall Lands, that were altogether unknown to former Ages the which You ſubjected to Your own Dominions: But yet all theſe Politicall and Martial Vertues, are nothing in compariſon of Your Chriſtian Vertues, and Your Zeal to the Reformed Religion; For no ſooner had You freed Your ſelves from the Yoak of the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; but You willingly ſubmitted Your necks to the ſervice of the Son of God, and made Your Country a Sanctuary, and Refuge to the poor Proteſtants, whether perſecuted in <hi>France</hi> or elſewhere.</p>
            <p>And thoſe Barbarians, that You ſubjugated in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> You ſubdued no leſſe to the Kingdom of the Son of God, then to Your own Signory; ſo joyning the glory of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Your own Intereſts, and enlarging the Empire of his Son with Your own; and marrying (which is rarely ſeen, and therefore ſeems almoſt impoſſible) the <hi>Maxims</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> together; Evidencing it to the whole world, that You are no leſſe good Chriſtians, then great Polititians.</p>

            <p>Now I beſeech God to give You length of dayes, with all ſort of Temporall Happineſſe in this World; and to heap upon You Eternall Bleſſings in the World to come: To powre out the moſt benigne and pretious influence of his Grace upon Your flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eſtates &amp; Provinces; to bleſſe all Your worthy undertakings; to make You proceed as You have begun, and to give You ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Victory over all Your Enemies, both Spirituall and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, to the end Your Signories may continue as firm and ſtable as the Heavens.

            <p>THou haſt here two Treatiſes; the first concerning the Iudgements and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the Reformed Churches, touching the buſineſſe of Independency, which may very well be equipollent, if not preferable to an Oeucumenick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>; For in a Councell, it is no ſuch matter of wonder, that men that are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually together, and evermore conferring one with another, ſhould agree in their Opinions: But this ſeemes rather a thing altogether admirable, that Theſe ſeverall Churches, notwithstanding they are ſo ſeparated, and divided in regard of the diſtances of their Places, ſhould jumpe ſo harmoniouſly in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and Conſent of their Opinions. The ſecond is the Duply of Doctor <hi>Steuart,</hi> to a Booke of <hi>M. S. alias,</hi> of two Brethren, who for very ſhame thought it their beſt and ſafeſt way, to conceale their Names, expreſſing only their fond, and erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinions, and conceits. Now, good Reader, I ſhall entreat this one favour at thy hands, that thou wilt conferre diligently Doctor <hi>Steuarts</hi> Obſervations, and the pretended Anſwer of <hi>M.</hi> S. and thou ſhalt finde, that they have anſwered nothing at all to the purpoſe; for that they omit wholly many of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Queſtions, as that Touching the Power of the Members of the Church, &amp;c. and of thoſe few they do cull out here, and there; they anſwer not all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments brought by the Doctor for making of them good, but only thoſe they finde to be the weakeſt; And thoſe Arguments they do attaque him upon, they do
<pb facs="tcp:121103:5"/>but only ſcratch at them, and never give them any ſolid, or ſubſtantiall Anſwer; contenting themſelves with their <hi>jerkes</hi> of <hi>Language,</hi> their <hi>ralleries,</hi> injuries, or with ſome Rhetoricall <hi>Digreſſion</hi> from the buſineſſe in hand, the which thou wilt eaſily perceive, if thou pleaſe to conferre Page with Page, Queſtion with Queſtion, and Argument with Argument, which I inſtantly deſire thee thou wouldſt doe. So as it was no way needfull, that Doctor <hi>Steuart</hi> ſhould have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any Confutation at all, or vindicated his Obſervations. And in very deed, theſe laſt Pieces that he hath written, were not undertaken ſo much for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good of his owne Arguments, or the Refutation of <hi>M.</hi> S. as that he might treat more largely and fully ſome Queſtions, which he had only briefly toucht at in his Obſervations; As alſo that he might draw thoſe Foxes out of their Holes, bringing light out of their darke Writings, and ſo give ſome ſatisfaction to weak Brethren, who ordinarily ſuffer themſelves to be carried away with the ſtreame of Language, rather then with force of Arguments.</p>
            <p>Now I have entituled this Treatiſe, <hi>Zorobabel</hi> to <hi>Sanballat,</hi> not ſo much, to compare the Perſons, as the Cauſes one with another, betwixt which there ſeemes to be very great Affinity, and reſemblance; For

                  <item>
                     <hi>3.</hi> They came from a farre Country to dwell at Hieruſalem, ſo theſe are come too from farre, from America, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>4.</hi> They made as though they would build the Temple together with the Jewes; but in effect they had not the leaſt intention ſo to doe, as not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them at all: So, Theſe here make faire ſemblamces, as though they meant to build with us; They are Members of the Synod, but yet are loath to acknowledge them.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>5.</hi> The Jewes were ready to have received them, had they found they had proceeded with ſincerity; And ſo ſhould we be ready to receive theſe, could we finde they proceeded ſincerely.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>6.</hi> They diſcouraged the Worke-men, and retarded the Worke; ſo do theſe, as is but too apparent.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>7.</hi> They accuſed the Jews, that they purpoſed to rebell againſt the King; So theſe men in like manner charge us, that we give not power enough to the Magiſtrate.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>8.</hi> Maugre all the impediments, that they caſt in the way of Gods people, to hinder the Building of the Temple, it came at laſt, though not till a long time after that, to be finiſhed and compleated: So, we well hope, that in deſpite of Theſe the ſpirituall Temple ſhall at laſt be built up to Gods glory.</item>

            <p>THe reverend Paſtour of our Church, Mr. <hi>Breittinger,</hi> after the receit of your letters, being himſelfe much indiſpoſed, by reaſon of his great Age, has charged me to return you Anſwer in his name, that that Independencie of Conſiſtories, whereof you write, is not approved by our Churches, and that the Synode was not ignorant of the order and Diſcipline of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; yet nevertheleſſe, that theſe Churches would not be wanting to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their dutie, if it were required of them to declare their Opinion hereabouts; It is verie much to be lamented, that Church-men neglecting the religious reverence due unto a ſolemne Oath and Covenant, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Rites of the Church of Scotland, with which in ſuch things, the Tranſmarine Churches doe agree; That amongſt us, the Inferiour Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not in any ſervile manner ſubject, but only ſubordinate unto the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:121103:6"/>that ſo the Church of God, as a well diſciplined Armie, might the better keep her owne people in order and dutie, and ſo be more formidable to her Adverſaries; That howſoever our Churches are verie carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Chriſtian libertie, they be no leſſe to repreſſe by their Synodicall Cenſures, all licentiouſneſſe and Libertiniſme whatſoever: That juſt ſo the Conſiſtorie, or Colloque held at Antioch, depended upon the judgement and Cenſure of the Synod held at Ieruſalem; That the Spirits of the Prophets ought to be ſubject to the Prophets.</p>
            <p>Sir, Theſe are the things that the good Reverend old man enjoyned mee, together with his beſt love and affection to you, to acquaint you with apart. The mercifull God be preſent with, and aſſiſt his afflicted and diſtreſſed Church, and ſo direct your Synod by the ſpirit of peace, that they may una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly agree upon it, to eſtabliſh the beſt modell and frame of a Church, ſuch an one, as by Covenant they ſtand obliged to ſeeke after.</p>

L'Eſcriture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joint ſouvent la Force de l'Egliſe avec ſa beauté; mais ny l'une ny l'aultre de ces gracet ne peut conſerver ſa vigueur, ſi l'on vient à negliger ce grand appuy, &amp; ceſt exquis ornement, qu'elle trie des Aſſemblées Generales. C'eſt la que ſes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſe rallient, &amp; qu'elle eſt redoutable commo un Camp qui marche à Enſeignes deſployées en une Saincte Pompe. C'eſt là que ſon viſage paroiſt en une donlce gloire, ayant efface les taſches, &amp; eſtendu les rides, dont les opinions, &amp; les paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions particulieres auoyent terni ſon luſtre. C'eſt là que ſu teſte reluict, comme Couronnee d'Eſtoiles, &amp; quelle porte en ſa main les deux Verges de plaiſances &amp; de liaiſons.

Ils aſſemblerent un Concile, qui doibt ſervir de patron &amp; de Miroüer à taicte la poſterité des Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles, juſq' à la fin du Monde. Quand la celebration de la Paſque fut mis en controverſe, laiſſa-on la liberté à chaſcune des Egliſes de la celebrer à ſa poſte: On aſſembla je ne ſcay combien de Synodes, où on ordonna, qu'on auroit à la ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrer le Dimanche. Ainſi Conſtantin voyant les Eveſques &amp; les peuples ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dés les uns contre les aultres, comme des Symplejados, pour uſer du terme d'Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebe, aſſembla le Synode de Nicée, comme s'il euſt levé une Armée à Dieu, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, meſmes au raport de Theodoret &amp; de Socrate, qu'il n'avoit, point trouvé aultre moyen d'eſtablir quelque choſe de ferme &amp; d'aſſeuré. Mais il faudroit
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:121103:7"/>faire un tiſſu de toutes les Epoches de l'Egliſe, ſi nous voulions alleguer icy tout ce qui pourroit ſervir à noſtre ſubject. Ce ſont choſes ſi claires &amp; ſi cogneues, qu'il ſeroit inutile d'en parler, ſi cela ne juſtifioit la procedure tenuê aujourdhuy dans toutes les Egliſes Orthodoxes: Car nous n'en cognoiſſons point, qui confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mement à l'Egliſe primitive ne s'eſtime heureuſe, quand elle peut voir les ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teurs de Dieu en Saincte Congregation, reiglants d'un co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mun accord ce qui regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ou la bien-ſeance du ſervice, ou meſme les poincts de Doctrine, par la raiſon, &amp; par l'Eſcriture, qui eſt au deſſus de toute Raiſon. Et quand à nous puis quil vous a pleü nous demander noſtre advis, nous proteſtons haut et clair, quelques Ennemis que nous ſoyons de la Tyrannie, que nous ne le ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes pas moins de l'Anarchie: nous deteſtons avec l'uſurpation du Pape les fureurs des Anabaptistes: nous priſons auſſi bien, que nos Peres un Concile libre, convoquè au nom de Dieu, où ſon Esprit &amp; ſa Parole preſident; &amp; ne doubtons point, que les moindres Compag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ne doibuent du reſpect et de la deference aux plus grandes, comme noſtre pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctique le teſmoigne. L'exemple du Synode de Dordrecht, ou nous avions nos De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petès, est un illuſtre monument de la benediction, que Dieu verſe ſur ces Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleés generales: Il eſt vray neantmoins, que les circonſtances des temps, &amp; les intereſts des Princes, chez qui l'Arche repoſe, n'en donnent pas tousjours la per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: Mais dans les Royaumes, qui jouiſſent de ceſte precieuſe libertè, ceſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roit une ingrate felonie, de ſe priver volontairement, &amp; ſans neceſſité, d'un ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ineſtimable. Tandis que ceux, qui le poſſedent font ſcrupule de s'en ſervir, ceux à qui on le deſend, le ſoubaitent avec une juſte paſſion. Avec quelle joye penſez vous, que les Egliſes de France ſouſpirent apres ce bon-heur, de ſe voir aſſemblèes, en Synode National, ſuivant l'Octroy, qu'elles en ont eu ceſte annèe? Il faut advouer neantmoins, qu'il s'eſt trouve de grandes Aſſemblèes, cù il y a eu moins de defenſeurs de la Verite, que de Partiſans du Menſonge. Mais auſſi nous ne parlons, que de celles, où l'Esprit de Dieu &amp; ſa Parole tiennent le timon, &amp; qui n'eſtabliſſent rien de contraire aux lumieres &amp; aux perſuaſions, que ce meſme Eſprit, &amp; ceſte meſme Parole forment dans les coeurs de tous les Fideles. Quon attende done, que Dieu, laſchant la bride à la perſecution, en ſa juſte cholere nous oſte le moyen d'aſſembler des Colloques &amp; des Synodes. Mais tandis que ſa bonne Providence nous accorde ce privilege, ne nous rendons point indignes d'un effect ſi raze de ſa bonte. C'eſt ce que j'avoye à vous dire, Monſieur, de la part de Meſſieurs mes Collegues, &amp; par un conſentement unanime.

            <p>I Have ſhewed our Conſiſtory the writing which you were pleaſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe to them by my meanes; whereby, after you have deduced the Cauſes of your Troubles, and the divers obſtacles, that keep back ſo long the publique peace, you demand of us our Advice, and particularly as to the Opinions of certain of the Members of your Synod, that maintaine, that all Churches may be ſufficiently governed by their Conſiſtories, every one a part, without any dependance at all upon the greater Aſſemblies, that have fuller Authority, ſuch as are the Colloques, and the Provinciall, and Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Synods; To which Head I have direction from them to write unto you, that as our bowels have ever earned in compaſſion toward you, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your misfortunes, having been very ſenſible of the Afflictions of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and conſidered the ſad face of your Churches, as a calamity, that touches us very neare, however we beheld it but at ſuch a diſtance: ſo we can doe no other then redouble our ſighes, to underſtand how the Devill ſowes his Tares during the darke night of your Affliction, and ſtirrs up ſuch diverſity of Spirits, who through a zeale voyd of Knowledge teare in pieces that ſeameleſſe Coate of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt. But that which touches us yet nigher, is, that into an Aſſembly, that ſhould have no other levell, or ayme, ſave ſuch a peace as may be Holy, ſuch differences, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings ſhould glyde, and inſinuate themſelves, as ought not to ſpring up amongſt the Servants of God, or that Chriſtian Prudence ought, at leaſt, to ſtifle in their very birth, and firſt Riſe, following the Authority of the Holy Scripture, the Cuſtome of the Primitive Church, the Hiſtory of all Ages, and the Experience of our owne Times. For not to ſtay my ſelfe upon the name of Independents, which they take, or others call them by, though it deſerve for ever to be baniſhed from among thoſe that are Orthodox, and to be left to the Councells, or to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> know we not that the internall Kingdome of our Lord Ieſus, Soveraigne Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the Church, which tends all to unity (to conſummate all in One, as He is one with his Father) cannot poſſibly entertaine an Union without a Communion of the Spirit? And is not this Communion extreamly weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by meanes of the diſtractions of the ſeverall members of the Body, and by reaſon of the obſtruction of the Veſſells, which ſhould ſerve her as ſo many Conduit-pipes? How ſhould this Spirit freely paſſe up and downe from one part of the Body to the other, for the entire aggregation of the Body of the Saints, by its influence if a ſingularity of Diſcipline, as a thick Hedge, interpoſe, and choake up its way? How ſhould ever this Body grow into a perfect man, according to the meaſure of that perfect ſtature of Chriſt in all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:121103:8"/>its joynts, if ſo be that the Foot have no need of the Eye; if the inferiour mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers disjoynt, and looſe themſelves from the noble parts, and the noble deſpiſe the leſſe honourable, which yet are the more neceſſary? How can the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Spirituall Temple be advanced, if the worke-men will needs doe their worke every one a part, and will not maintaine a cloſe correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and underſtanding the one with the other? Or this Heavenly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my how ſhall it ever be able to vanquiſh its Enemies, when we ſee its Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons breake thus their Files, and that its Bounds are ſo badly ranged? The Scripture often tyes the Power of the Church, and her Beauty in one band together; But neither the one, nor the other of theſe Graces can ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its ſtrength, if men come once to ſet at naught that exquiſite prop, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, that Generall Aſſemblies afford it. There it is, that the Church ſtill re-inforces her ſelfe, and where ſhe makes her ſelfe formidable, as an Army, that marches with Banners flying, in a kind of Holy Triumph. There it is, where her Countenance appeares glorious, after ſhe hath gotten out the ſtaines, and filled up the wrinckles, wherewith particular Mens Opinions, and paſſions had eclipſed her luſtre. There it is, that her Head comes to ſhine as bright, as though ſhe were Crowned with Starres, and that ſhe <hi>beares</hi> in her <hi>Hands</hi> thoſe two <hi>ſtaves</hi> of <hi>Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Bands.</hi> And to ſave my ſelfe the labour of alleadging here the Policy of the Church of the Iewes, wherein notwithſtanding it is evident, that the great Councell of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim</hi> had an authentique direction; <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> in their Diſpute touching Ceremonies, had they their recourſe to any private man, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Conſiſtorys, or decided they the point in controverſie every one by his private Authority, as he conceived of it? No, they aſſembled a Councell; w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſhould ſerve as a Glaſſe, and patterne to all the poſterity of the Faithful, even to the end of the world. When as the Celebration of Eaſter Day was ſo much controverted, was every Church left to its liberty to celebrate it after its own guiſe and faſhion? No, here were aſſembled I know not how many Synods, wherein it was ordered, that it ſhould be celebrated conſtantly on the Lords Day. So when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſaw how the Biſhops, &amp; the People banded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves one againſt the other, like to <hi>Symplejades,</hi> to uſe <hi>Euſebius</hi> his terme, he convocated the Nicene Synod, as though he had leavyed an Army for God, proteſting thereupon, (according to the report of <hi>Theodores</hi> &amp; <hi>Socrates</hi>) that he had not found out any other meanes, to ſettle any thing that might be firm and holding. But we ſhould be forced to interweave all the Epoches of the Church, if we ſhould bring here all that might be brought to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Theſe things are ſo cleare, and ſo well knowne, that it ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſefull to ſpeak of them, did they not juſtifie the proceedings held at this day every where in the Orthodox Churches; For we know not of any one, that in a Conformity with the Primitive Church, accounts not her ſelfe happy, when ſhe can ſee the Servants of God gathered into an Holy Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:121103:8"/>regulating with common conſent that, which appertaines either to the <hi>Decorum</hi> of the ſervice, or elſe the points of Doctrine, by reaſon, and by Scripture, which is farre above all Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And for our ſelves, ſince you are pleaſed to demand our Advice, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to all the world, how great Enemies ſoever we are of Tyranny, that we are no whit leſſe of Anarchy; We abominate and deteſt together with the uſurpations of the Pope the madneſſe of the Anabaptiſts: We prize as high, as ever did our Fathers, a free Councell, convocated in the name of God, wherein his Spirit, and Word may preſide, and have the caſting voyce; and we are clearely of Opinion, that the leſſer ſocieties owe reſpect, and depend upon the Greater, as our Practiſe witneſſes with us. The Example of the Synod of Dordrecht, where we had our Deputies, is a famous monument of the Bleſſing God powers out upon Generall Aſſemblies. We may not deny notwithſtanding, that the circumſtances of Times, and Intereſts of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with whom the Arke of God reſts, admit not evermore ſuch Meetings. But in thoſe Kingdomes, that enjoy ſuch a precious liberty, it ſhould be a moſt unthankefull Felony againſt God, that men ſhould voluntarily, when there is no neceſſity at all, deprive themſelves of ſuch an eſtimable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Whilſt as thoſe, that are in poſſeſſion hereof, are ſcrupulous to ſerve themſelves of the occaſion; thoſe that have a Reſtraint upon them deſire this happineſſe exceedingly. With what joy thinke you, doe the Churches of France long after the happineſſe to ſee themſelves once aſſembled in a Nationall Synod, according to the Grant they have obtained to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this yeare? It muſt be confeſſed notwithſtanding, that ſome Councels a man may meet with, where he ſhall find fewer Defenders of the Truth, then Champions for Errour. But we ſpeak not but of thoſe, where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and his Word hold the rather; and of ſuch, as uſe not to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh any thing contrary to thoſe lights, and perſwaſions, which the ſame Spirit, and the ſame Word doe frame within the hearts of all the Faithfull. Let us therefore ſtay the time, till God, letting out the raynes to a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in his juſt indignation deprive us of the meanes of Aſſemblies, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loques, and Synods; But as long as his good Providence grants us this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, let us not make our ſelves unworthy of ſo rare an Effect of his Bounty.</p>
            <p>Sir, This is that, which I had to ſay unto you from an unanimous conſent of all my Collegues. We pray God with all our hearts, that he will looke upon Sion in much pitty, that he will rouze up his Iealouſie, and thoſe year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning compaſſionate Bowells, wherewith he uſes to be moved towards his Churches, and that he will be pleaſed ſpeedily to give us occaſion to glorifie his Holy Name in your deliverance. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               </item>
               <item>3. According to the Scripture, <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> point out but one and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:121103:14"/>the ſame Chriſt, howſoever in divers reſpects; one of thoſe <hi>names,</hi> which ſeemes to be derived from their <hi>age,</hi> or yeares, denotes ſuch a gravity as befits Chriſts Miniſters; and the other expreſſeth their Office, that is, to watch over the <hi>Flock</hi> which is common to them both.</item>
               <item>4 It is as cleare, as the day, that in Scripture <hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> mark out one and the ſame Charge; for there were many <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the ſame Town, Phil. 1. and the very ſame perſons are qualified indifferently, both <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Biſhop,</hi> Acts 20.1.</item>
               <item>5. So as we take it to be the ſureſt way, to hold our ſelves cloſe to that Apoſtolique ſimplicity, that the Church of God be governed by <hi>Paſtors, Antients,</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. But we underſtand on all hands, and the Writings of the Biſhops themſelves make it good, that they have hither-to made a Body a part, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from other Poſtors, likewiſe that they take an Authority upon them, and a ſuperiority over the other Paſtors of the Church, which they will needs have to be of Divine Right. Likewiſe that they beleeve, that they alone are the <hi>Repreſentative Church of the Nation;</hi> that they challenge to themſelves the cognizance, and abſolute diſpoſall of all the Affaires of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; that they exerciſe a dominion over their Brethren, whom the Forme of their Diſcipline hath put in a kind of ſubjection unto them, and treate the Paſtors not as their Brethren and equalls by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> but as Subjects and ſervants; which being granted, it cannot be avoided but they muſt be accounted, as thoſe that have exerciſed a kind of Tyranny in the Houſe of God, and maintained the arts of Antichriſtianiſme.</item>
               <item>7. Wherefore many of our men conſidering the ſtate of the Church of England, which God had delivered from the Errours and the Idolatries of the Church of Rome, how notwithſtanding ſhe ſtill retained the Pompe of Hierarchy, and Ceremonies, had juſt cauſe to ſay, that the Body of the great Whore was indeed taken away, but that her Veſtments and Apparrell ſtill remained with her.</item>
               <item>8. We were much joyed, when we underſtood, that things were ſo well fitted and diſpoſed toward an holy Reformation in England; being well aſſured, that the power, which the Biſhops had uſurped, and which, till this preſent, was given them, ought to be entirely ſuppreſſed, and aboliſhed.</item>
               <item>9. But we are much afflicted that among them that put their hand to ſo holy and neceſſary a work there, there are ſome that paſſe from one Extream to another, willing, that every particular Church be ſo abſolute and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, that it depend not upon any other for its direction, nor be obliged to give an account to other Churches of its Government.</item>
               <item>10. We conceive, that this is not only to pull in pieces the garment, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Body of our Lord, and his Spirituall Tabernacle; and to take away from the Church the title of the Communion of Saints; to divide that which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:121103:14"/>God hath joyned together by his Holy Spirit, the which being the ſpirit of peace inſpires; where ever it bloweth, peace, concord, and brotherly and charitable communication, and leades us to lend each other of us the hand to maintaine the whole together in a ſpirituall ſympathy, and a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall ayding and aſſiſting one of another.</item>
               <item>11. Beſides, that under the pretence of caſting out Tyranny, it is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce and bring in an Anarchie and confuſion into the Houſe of God, and to open a wide gate to all ſorts of diſaſters, which are apparently unavoy da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if every particular Church ſhake off all manner of Yoake, and refuſe to give an account of its behaviour unto the aſſembly of his Brethren, attributing unto itſelfe an abſolute power to doe whatſoever it ſelfe pleaſe, without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering unto any therefore, ſave to God only: For if we open a gare to ſuch a licentiouſneſſe, the Socinians, the Anabaptiſts; and generally all ſort of Hereticks, Fanaticks, and Enthuſiaſtsſhall quickly find the mean of ſeducing the people to poſſeſſe themſelves of the Pulpits, and ſo to make havock of the Churches of God.</item>
               <item>12. Moreover, this pretended Independence ingageth them that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it, in a manifeſt contradiction, for ſince they confeſſe, that the Church of England is a Body, they muſt neceſſarily avow that its parts ought to be united and tyed together, which ſhould be abſolutely impoſſible, ſhould every Church be obliged to make a combination a part, and to ſtand Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon another Church.</item>
               <item>13. From the very birth of the Chriſtian Church unto this preſent, there hath never been ſuch a Government eſtabliſhed, as theſe men at this time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound: on the contrary, the mutual and reciprocall dependence of Churches, and the uniting of them all together to a certaine Eccleſiaſticall Order and Politie, having been debated by a common deliberation, hath been accepted voluntarily by all, and hath ever been judged abſolutely neceſſary.</item>
               <item>14. But to reſt my ſelfe upon the Scripture alone; we have it <hi>formally</hi> enjoyned without any exception, to ſubmit our ſelves one to another in the feare of God, Eph. the 4. and to goe one before another, Rom. 12. God would have every thing in his Houſe <hi>decently</hi> and <hi>in order,</hi> and as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets, ſo thoſe that Propheſie ought to ſubject themſelves one to the other, remembring, that God is not the God of confuſion, but of peace, 1 Cor. 14.</item>
               <item>15. The Apoſtle, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> had beene called by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt unto the Apoſtleſhip immediatly, ſo as that he had neither received, nor learnt any thing of any man, and yeelded not in any thing to to thoſe, that would ſeeme ſomething, and acknowledged not that thoſe that were in place had added any thing unto him; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he tooke not himſelfe for an Independent: but after that he had three yeares together Preached the Goſpell, and wrought divers miracles, he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:121103:15"/>diſdaines not to goe to Ieruſalem to viſit <hi>Peter,</hi> and to receive the right hand of fellowſhip. And like wiſe he went up ten yeares after by Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Ieruſalem, to conſerte with the Apoſtles touching the Goſpell, to the end (ſaith he) leaſt by any meanes I had not, or ſhould have run in vaine, Gal. 2, In concluſion, after that he had undergone a world of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and was become famous for many ſignes and miracles, and had made the Goſpel of Chriſt to flouriſh from Ieruſalem unto Illyricum, Rom. 1.17. he maketh no difficulty or ſcruple to ſubmit himſelfe unto the Counſell, that the Church of Ieruſalem gave him, although he had never required any Counſell at their hands, Acts 21.</item>
               <item>16. Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that was the firſt in order in the Colledge of the Apoſtles, beleeves not himſelfe to be an Independent, when he perceiveth that they were offended with his manage of the affaires, he preſents himſelfe boldly to his Brethren, as they were aſſembled in Ieruſalem, and gives them an account of what had paſſed by the meanes of his Miniſtery in the <hi>Calling</hi> of the Gentiles, Act, 11. And when he went not the right way to the truth of the Goſpell: he endured himſelf to be reprehended publickly, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.</item>
               <item>17. The Church of Antioch was the firſt, that was honoured with the Title of Chriſtian, and it had famous men immediatly inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt; Amongſt others, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> And yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when there hapned amongſt them a Controverſie of importance, it preſumed not to decide it of it ſelfe alone; it preſumed not to ſhew it ſelfe Independent; but contrariwiſe, it ſent <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> with ſome others to Hieruſalem, where a Councell was called, conſiſting of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Elders; And the Queſtion that was firſt of all moved, and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Antioch, was examined, and decided at Hieruſalem, to the glory of God, and the edification of the Church, Acts 15.</item>
               <item>18. For very great, important, and juſt reaſons, it is decreed to aboliſh the Epiſcopacy, but it were leſſe miſchiefe and inconvenience by farre to <hi>ſuffer</hi> it, after that the Exceſſes of it were corrected, and the Tyranny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, then to bring in ſuch an horrible confuſion, as is vailed under this name of Independency.</item>
               <item>19. God be thanked, there is no need to come to that; For if the Church of England will obſerve the order already happily eſtabliſhed in ours, and the Churches of Scotland, if I miſtake not, it ſhall receive much profit, and edification thereof, and ſhall ſee the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and of true Piety reigne, and flouriſh more then ever in the midſt of her people.</item>
               <item>20. In every particular Church, there ought to be a Body, made up of Paſtors, or of Paſtors, Ancients, and Deacons, that may meet in Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon ſet, and appointed daies, to adviſe by common conſent, of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and the Government of the Church.</item>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:121103:15"/>
               <item>21. If there be but one Paſtor in theſe Conſiſtories, He preſides there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore, But if there chance to be more, they preſide by turnes.</item>
               <item>22. In great Cities, and Townes, as in London, where there are many Pariſhes, every Pariſh may have its particular Conſiſtory, made up of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, Ancients, and Deacons; And yet notwithſtanding to entertaine an holy, Chriſtain like, and Brotherly union, and concord, ſuch as ought to be among the Faithfull, that are of the ſame Towne, we are of Opinion, that it would doe well, that every weeke, or Moneth at leaſt, a Generall Conſiſtory ſhould be held, where the other Conſiſtories ſhould meete either in their Bodies, or by their Deputies, if their number be too great; The Paſtors of the ſeveral Pariſhes may preſide by turnes, or as it ſhall be agreed upon by a common choiſe; And the buſineſſes, that ſhall be there propounded, ſhall be there decided by plurality of voyces.</item>
               <item>23. Over and above this, It will be needfull to eſtabliſh the Order of Colloques, and of Provinciall Synods, conſiſting of Paſtors, and Antients, deputed by the particular Churches; and of Nationall Synods, conſiſting of Paſtors, and Ancients, deputed by the Provinciall Synods; And that there may be a proceding in theſe holy Aſſemblies from ſtep to ſtep according to the quality, and merit of Buſineſſes.</item>
               <item>24. The Colloques may be held once, or twice a yeare, or oftner, if there be buſineſſes, that require it. The Provinciall Synods ought to be held once at the leaſt in a yeare; As for the Nationall Synods, we conceive it will be ſufficient, that yee hold them from two to two, or from three yeares to three yeares.</item>
               <item>25. The Eccleſiaſtique Aſſembly now ſitting may make Rules touching the matters, which the Conſiſtorie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <item>26. In all theſe Colloques, and Synods, as well Provinciall, as Nationall, after the invocation of the Name of God, the Preſident, the Aſſeſſor, or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors, and the Secretaries ſhould be Elected by plurality of voyces, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the end, and ſhutting up of the Aſſembly, they are to ſubmit themſelves, as well as all the reſt of the Company to the Cenſure of their Brethren.</item>
               <item>27. Thoſe that are conſecrated to the Holy Miniſtery, after they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven good, and ſufficient teſtimony of their lives, and manners, ought to be examined in the Provinciall Synods, or at leaſt in the Colloques, who having judged them capable are to ſend them with letters of Recommendation, to thoſe Churches, that demand them; where, after they have by ſome Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Sermons given a proofe of their gifts, and the dexterity they have individing a right the Word of God, and received the approbation of the people, they receive the Impoſition of Hands by the Paſtors, that are depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that purpoſe.</item>

For that after the breaking up of the Aſſemblies, they that preſided in them have no more power, then they had before the Calling of them, To the intent there may alwaies be ſome conſtant, and ſet order betweene the Churches; Before ſuch time as the Aſſembly part, it ought to enjoyne ſome one certaine Church to give and receive the Adviſe of all the reſt of the Churches of the Colloque, or of the Province, and to give it power in caſe of neceſſity, to convocate a Colloque, or Provinciall Aſſembly Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. The Nationall Synod ought alſo to <hi>give it in charge to the Provinciall Synod,</hi> commit the care to call the Nationall Synod that is next to be, to the Provinciall Synod.</item>
               <item>30. We are of Opinion, that by the meanes of ſuch an order once ſetled, you will be able to remedy all that is amiſſe; For on the one ſide there will be no primacy, nor dominion of ſome particular Churches over others, and on the other ſide you ſhall by that meanes chaſe out of the Houſe of God all diſorder, and confuſion.</item>

            <p>IT is true, that conſidering that the pretended Independency, that ſome would bring in in England, is the way to open a wide gate to a moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full confuſion, and that by the means therof the Devil is ſo buſie to pull down whatſoever yee build up: in my nineteenth Article I ſaid, That for very great, very important, and moſt juſt reaſons, it was reſolved upon to aboliſh, and pull downe the Epiſcopacy, but that there was leſſe miſchiefe, and inconvenience to permit it, after a due correction of the Exceſſes of it, and an aboliſhment of its Tyranny, then to bring into the Church of God ſuch
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:121103:16"/>an horrible confuſion, as ſeem'd to be conched, and vayled under the name of INDEPENDENCY.</p>
            <p>I freely confeſſe unto you, that I am yet of the very ſame Opinion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your reaſoning to the contrary. I ſay then 1. that though ſuch a Tolerance might give ſomewhat to many to apprehend, and ſuſpect, yet the Evills, that could poſſibly thence arive, would be without compariſon, farre leſſe, then thoſe that this unbridled <hi>Licenſing</hi> of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents might introduce among you; Now of two Evills, you would doe well to chooſe the leſſer. 2. I conceived not, that there was ſo great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in tolerating the Biſhops, provided that they were ranged within the order of other Paſtours, ſo as that they might not have dominion over them, but only a certaine Preſidency, and Commiſſion to watch over their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and that this Commiſſion were given them by the Colloque, or the Synod of the Province, and that thoſe Aſſemblies had the power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to deprive them of it, and to ſubſtitute others in their Places. 3. There are many things eſtabliſhed in the Government of the Church, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, and expreſly are not to be found in the Word of God. 4. It hath pleaſed God, to give this in charge to thoſe that he hath called to the guidance, and Government of his Flock. His Will is, that All things in his Houſe be done in order, and to edification. 5. You your ſelf, uſe yee not to chooſe from amongſt your Paſtors ſome perſons to preſide in your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loques, and in your Synods? Is this <hi>formally,</hi> and expreſly in the Word of God? A Preſidency for certain Moneths, or for certain Yeares is it of it ſelfe more faulty, or criminall, then that of yours for certaine daies, or certaine weekes? 6. Conſider, if it pleaſe you, that <hi>Parker,</hi> and other learned men of your Nation that have written againſt the Hierarchy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, how that were the Biſhops in England but as the Paſtors in Germany, and Suitzer-land, which they uſuall ſtiley Inſpectors, and Super-intendents, they would never goe about to put them downe. 7. Put the caſe this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were eſtabliſhed amongſt the Paſtors, it were not properly to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh an office, that is not in the Word of God; for if it be well thought on, theſe Inſpectors have not any other Office in the Church of God, then the other Paſtors, they are but onely delegated by their Brethren, and Fellow Miniſters, and have from them and by their order a Commiſſion for a time, to watch over their Brethren, as their Brethren may have a like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, when their turne comes, to watch over them, and their behaviours. Iuſt ſo, as if in a well governed Family, Brethren ſhould make an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to give ſome one amongſt them a Commisſion to watch for a certaine time over the deportment of the reſt; and this without any domination, or command. 8. To conclude, ſir, you and we may eaſily agree upon this Article; For you beleeve you are bound abſolutely to aboliſh the Biſhops of England, and to ſhut quite out of doores the confuſion of the Independents,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:121103:17"/>my thoughts are the ſame, and I approve your deſigne wholly, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God with all my heart, that he would bleſſe the worke of your hands, and that you may ſee thoſe happy daies, wherein the Churches of England being purely Reformed, may enjoy the ſame Diſcipline, which is holily eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in thoſe of Scotland.</p>
            <p>You are pleas'd in your letter to adde ſomething concerning the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, but you doe but only alleadge that which they beleeve, and touch not upon any of the Reaſons, upon which they ground themſelves; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall but only give a ſlight touch with my Pen upon every one of your ſven Articles.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, I thanke you moſt affectionately for the Copies of your Covenant, the which I had ſeene before, and had praiſed God, who is the Author of this Chriſtian peace, and of this holy agreement, of which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect great fruit to the glory of God, and the edification of his Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Independents doe but make ſport, when they ſay, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Synods, and Colloques are of Divine Right, and deny them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any manner of juriſdiction over particular Churches. This is to pull downe with one hand what they build with the other. For I cannot comprehend, what uſe at all there can be of Colloques, and Synods, if they have no juriſdiction over particular Churches, and leſſe yet, how one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church can refuſe to ſubmit it ſelfe to a generall Aſſembly, the which it acknowledges to be of Divine Right.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now to that, that they will not admit any one for a member of their Congregation, that hath not ſome notable, and conſpicuous markes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, <hi>I</hi> conceive not that this opinion can have many Followers; for that the members of the Church conſiſt either of the Infants of Beleevers, or of perſons of perfect Age. As for the children of Beleevers there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty at all, for the Apoſtle calls them Saints in regard of the Covenant of God, that ſanctifies, and makes them holy; And as for the others, either they are borne amongſt us, or they come to our party by Converſion. As for them that are converted, it is true, that they ought not hand overhead to be admitted into the body of the Church, and that it does well to have ſome prooſes of their knowledge in Religion, as alſo ſome teſtimonies of their holy Converſation, to the end that the Church be not defiled with their unſoundneſſe. But in this Examination we muſt proceed with charity, and not be over ſevere, for feare of caſting backe, and deſtroying of him, who is yet weake and feeble in the Faith. For as much as concernes thoſe that are already in the communion of the Church, the Rules of the Word of God are expreſſe concerning them; They, whoſe ſins are not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and notorious, we are to reprove, and cenſure them in private, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it were to ſpread a ſcandall, and to offend againſt charity, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a multitude of ſins. Theſe that ſin publickly, and whoſe ſins are notoriouſly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:121103:17"/>knowne to all, or the greater part of the people, are to be reproved pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and the buſineſſe is to be carried ſo, as that an amends be made by a publicke repentance for publick ſcandalls, in caſe that it be requiſite for the edification of the Church. If the Offences be enormious, or if the Offenders chance to be hardned, and obſtinate in their wickedneſle, we are to cut them off by <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and ſo to take from among us the old leven, that it ſoure not the whole lump, and that the accurſed thing cauſe not <hi>Iſrael</hi> to turne her backe. But the Offender (how great, or enormious ſo ever he be) if he repent, after a convenient time of triall of the truth of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we are bound to have compaſſion of him, and to readmit him to the peace of the Church, that he be not ſwallowed up with ſorrow, and caſt head-long into Deſpaire. It were good, we ſhould avoid, as the too great ſeverity, and rigidity of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> ſo likewiſe the over great levity, and indulgence, that is in vogue amongſt us at this day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to that, that they will have every particular member preſent at the deliberation of all buſineſſes whatſoever, without having any right of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, or Authority, I conceive this ſtands in need of ſome good diſtinction; for certaine occaſions there are, upon which a man may grant them more then they demand, as at ſuch times, when there is any debate touching buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that are extraordinary, and that concern the whole Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; for example, then, when as the queſtion is touching the vocation, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a Paſtor into a Church. In ſuch a caſe, I am of opinion, that all the Maſters of Families, that belong to that Church, not onely ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Conſultation, but alſo that they are to have their voyce and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage therein. But that they ſhould be at all kinds of debates, there ſeemes to be no colour for it; this neither can be, nor indeed is it expedient. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I ſay, be; for the Church having continually buſineſſes, whereon to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, how is it poſſible, the whole Church ſhould ſo often be congregated? Againe, I ſay it is no waies expedient; for there are certain buſineſſes, which ought not to be divulged, wherein Chriſtian Prudence, and ſecrecie are very neceſſary. If ſome particular man were to be cenſured for ſome particular offence, that few know of, and which, if it were known, would in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood expoſe him to a viſible, and apparent danger, were it fitting now to debate, and deliberate touching the cenſuring of this man, before the whole Congregation? Meet we at no time with buſineſſes of ſuch a nature, as wherein the ſimple people are neither capable of underſtanding the Reaſons, nor yet able to hold their peace? Muſt we needs abandon all Affaires of the Church to the diſcretion of every particular man? If the people were to aſſiſt in all Conſultations, what a noiſe, what conteſtations, what diviſions, what ſcandalls ſhould we have? For however ſome men perchance would forbeare to deliver an opinion, yet they would be ſure at the riſing of the Aſſembly to murmure at and condemne the Iudgements, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:121103:18"/>were paſſed, if either they were not to their good liking, or that they found them not to be grounded upon ſuch Reaſons, as themſelves approved of.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As to that, that they permit any one whatſoever, if he have the ability, to Preach publickly in their Aſſemblies, notwithſtanding that he have not <hi>Orders,</hi> This is one of the greateſt <hi>Diſorders,</hi> that can poſſibly happen in the world; This, what is it other, but to bring in all kinde of Fanatiques, and Enthuſiaſts, and to expoſe Chriſtian Religion to be made a laughing-ſtock to the Enemies of Gods Truth; And to make of the Houſe of God, which is an Houſe of <hi>Order,</hi> a Babell of <hi>Diſorder;</hi> and horrible Confuſion? It will ſerve them to little purpoſe to alleadge for themſelves the Example of the Ancient Church in the Times of the Apoſtles; for in thoſe times all the faithfull had Extraordinary Graces, as alſo the guift of <hi>Prophecie,</hi> and yet, for all that, were thoſe holy Prophets to ſtay till they were bidden to <hi>ſpeake,</hi> and untill ſuch time, as it was ſaid to them, as to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas; Men, Brethren, If you have any word of Exhortation, ſpeake on;</hi> which was a kind of <hi>Vocation.</hi> Now a daies, when men have not ſuch Infuſions of Guifts, but that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the <hi>Sciences,</hi> and <hi>abilities</hi> for Preaching by ſtudy, and paines, God powring forth his bleſſing upon their induſtry, it were to mocke God, and men, to require that all men ſhould Preach indifferently, without any praevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Examen of their Guifts, or the dexterity they have to divide the Word of God to Edification.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As to that, That many maintaine, that every man ought to have liberty to make profeſſion of whatſoever Religion himſelfe thinkes beſt (how bad ſoever it be) provided, that he attempt nothing againſt the State, wherein he lives; this is a Libertiniſme, not to be indured in the Houſe of God, and it is flatly againſt his <hi>Word;</hi> For in the Old Teſtament, it was not permitted to any to make profeſſion of any other Religion, ſave that which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had inſtituted; And you know, what God ordained againſt falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that turne away the people from his ſervice, Deut. 13. As alſo in the New Teſtament, how St. <hi>Paul</hi> wills us to take heed of ſuch, as make Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and raiſe ſcandalls againſt that Doctrin, that we have learn't; and that we turne away from them, Rom. 16. And that if an Apoſtle, or an Angell from Heaven preach another Goſpell unto us, then hath been preached, that he be accurſed, Gal. 1. yea St. <hi>Iohn</hi> (very ſweetneſſe, and Charity it ſelf) will not at any hand, that we receive into our houſes, no not that we ſo much as bid God ſpeed to thoſe, that bring us not the Doctrin of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As to that, That they make no reckoning either of the Iudgement, or Conſent of other <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> but reject them, as an humane Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſee they have profited little in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Schoole, whoſe Leſſon is, that we <hi>ſubmit our ſelves one to another in the feare of God;</hi> and that <hi>in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving honour, we goe one before the other; and that the ſpirits of the Prophets be ſubject to the Prophets.</hi> God forbid, we ſhould ever place Gods Ordinances,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:121103:18"/>and the Eccleſiaſticall Conſtitutions in the ſame ranke together. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God ſayes, ſhould be unto us a Law inviolable; But as for men, we are <hi>to prove all things,</hi> and <hi>to hold that which is good.</hi> For as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the Foundation, or Eſſence of Religion, there is none, but God alone, that can ordain any thing in it: But as to the Exteriour Order, and Policy of the Church, That wiſe Father of his Family is content to leave with us his Generall Word of direction, <hi>That in his Houſe all things be done decently, and in order;</hi> He leaves the particulars to the pious prudence of ſuch, as he hath called to the guidance, and Government of his people.</p>
            <p>It is their duty, when they are met together in the name of the Lord, to be earneſt Suiters, and Suppliants unto him, that he will pleaſe to preſide in the midſt of them, and put in their hearts to doe thoſe things, that ſhall be moſt expedient for his Glory, and the Edification of his Children. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of other Reformed Churches layes no abſolute yoake upon us, nor can it be propounded as any infallible Law; But true it is, it ought to be a Patterne and Example for our imitation, if ſo be we finde no manifeſt repugnancies in it to the Word of God. But if there be any, that is reſolved <hi>to be contentious hereabouts, we have no ſuch cuſtome, nor yet have the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p>We hold for certaine, that there neither is, nor ought to be any Office for <hi>teaching,</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> the Church, which ſhould not have its foundation and ground in Gods Word; And ſo the Office of Miniſter, Paſtor, Biſhop, Ancient, and Deacon, are founded immediatly, Formally, and Expreſly on the Word of God; howſoever ſome there be, that will needs have the Office of Ancients, as it is now practiſed in the Reformed Churches, to have no other ground at all in Scripture, ſave onely by Analogy, and as it is drawne thence by neceſſary Conſequence, as they ſpeake; which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is one and the ſame thing; For that which is deduced by neceſſary Conſequence from Scripture, is every jot as much in Scripture, as that, what ever it is, that is there in Expreſſe Termes. All this is agreeable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme with 29. and 30. Articles of the Confeſſion of Faith, where it is ſaid, That our Lord hath eſtabliſhed this Policy, and Government in his Church, viz. by Paſtors, Over-ſeers, or Ancients, and Deacons; And that thoſe that are true Paſtors, in what place ſoever they inhabit, have the very ſame Authority, and equall power under the Lord Ieſus Chriſt the chiefe Paſtor, and Biſhop of our ſoules, Act. 6.4. Eph. 4.11. 1 Tim. 3.1. Tit. 1.5. Matth. 20.26.18.2. 2 Cor. 1.27. 1 Pet. 5.3.</p>

            <p>VN mien amy homme vertueux &amp; craignant Dieu, m'a adverti que quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques perſonnes trouvent mauvais l'ordre eſtabli en nos Egliſes, par le quel les Conſiſtoires ſont ſubjects aux Colloques, &amp; les Colloques aux Synodes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciaux, &amp; les Provinciaux aux Nationaux. Ils voudroient que chaque Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtoire euſt une authoritè abſolue, &amp; qui ne dependiſt d'aucune aſſemblée ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieure: la deſſus ce mien amy me demande quel eſt mou ſeutiment: la choſe eſt de telle nature &amp; de telle importance, que je nay peu luy refuſer ce qu'il requiert de moy.</p>
            <p>Je dis donc, que ceux qui font telles Propoſitions, ne doivent eſtre creus: ſi on ſuiuois leur advis il ne ſ'en pourroit enſuiure que le renverſement de l'Egliſe &amp; une extreme confuſion: ſouvent advient que deux paſteurs d'une meſme Egliſe ſ'entrequerellent, &amp; diviſent le troupeau en deux factions contraires. En ce cas il faut par neceſſitè avoir recours a une compagnie &amp; puiſſance ſuperieure: que ſi l'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Egliſe nà qu'un Paſteur, &amp; que ce Paſteur ſoit vitieux, &amp; vive à'une vie ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daleuſe, &amp; ſoit ſupporté par le Conſiſtoire entier, ou que le Conſiſtoire ſoit diviſé, il n'y a point de remede a ce mal que par les Colloques &amp; Synodes ayants puiſſance de ſuſpendre ou depoſer un tel Paſteur: n'y ayant qu'un Paſteur en ceſte Egliſe, &amp; iceluy meritant d'eſtre depoſe, qui eſt ce qui le depoſera? Les Anciens du Conſiſtoire ſeuls prononceront ils contre luy ſentence de depoſition? Que ſi quelcun du peuple eſt injuſtement ſuſpendu de la Saincte Cene ou excommunié, a qui aura il recours pour eſtre reſtabli? &amp; a qui formera il ſes plainctes ſi le Conſiſtoire qui l'a in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtement condamnè a une Authorité Independante &amp; irrefragable.</p>
            <p>Que ſi une nouvelle Hereſie ſ'eſpand &amp; que quelques Paſteurs &amp; Egliſes en ſoyent infectées quel moyen d'obvier a un ſi grand mal, que par un Synode qui puiſſe depoſer les Paſteurs obſtinés en leur erreur, &amp; Inſectants le troupeau ſans le Synode de Dordrect, l'Arminianiſme ſespandroit par tout le pays, ſi chaque Conſiſtoire euſt eſté abſolu &amp; Independant, il euſt peu mespriſer la deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion du Synode, en diſant nous ne ſommes ſubjects a aucun Synode, &amp; avons une authorité abſolue &amp; Independante.</p>
            <p>L'es Synodes ſont principalement occupès a ouyr les plainctes des Egliſes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulieres, &amp; a juger des appels ſi vous oſtez cela aux Synodes, ils nont plus rien a faire, &amp; leur Convocation ſera inutile: Car auſſi eu vain prononceroient ils des jugements dont l'Execution ne ſeroit en leur puiſſance. Chaſque Conſiſtoireiſe gouvernezoit a ſa fautaſie: comme ſi en un grand pays, de chaque village, on fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoit une Souverainetè. Cela eſt vouloir introduire vn ordre qui depuis le temps des Apoſtres juſques a maintenant n'a jamais eſté practiqué.</p>
            <p>Il y a pluſieurs petites Egliſes Champeſtres, dont le Conſiſtoire eſt compoſè d'un Paſteur qui na pas beaucoup de capacité &amp; de quatre ou cinq payſans, qui ſont Ancicus de l'Egliſe: donner a on a une telle Egliſe ou Conſiſtoire, une autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritè
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:121103:19"/>Independante? &amp; ce Paſteur venant a mourir, ees payiſans auront ils le pouvoir d'èn choiſir un autre? ou de luy impoſer les mains, ſont ls Juges ſuffiſants de la capacitè d'un Miniſtre?</p>
            <p>Que ſi a cauſe de l'affliction de l'Egliſe il eſt beſoin de celebrer un jeuſue par toutes les Egliſes du Royaume, qui ordonnerace juſne? qui aſſignera le jour. S'il faut repreſenter au Prince Souverain les plaintes de toutes les Egliſes, qui eſce qui deputera? qui eſt ce qui preſentera les requeſtes de tout le corps des E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſes du Royaume?</p>
            <p>Si pour quelques occaſions ſurvenues il eſt beſoiug de changer quelque choſe en la Diſcipline Eccleſiaſtique, &amp; faire des nouveaux reglements qui obligent toutes les Egliſes, cela ſe pourra il faire par des Conſiſtoires Independants, &amp; nm ſubjects a aucun reglement general?</p>
            <p>Bref faut tenir pour conſtant que la Dependance des Compagnies inferieures ſubjectes aux Superieures, eſt le lien qui entretient l'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion de l'Egliſe, le quele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant couppê il ny auroit plus de correſpondance, &amp; on verroit une horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.

            <head>The Iudgement of a great Divine in <hi>France</hi> concerning Independency, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Letter directed to Master <hi>Buchanan.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A Friend of mine, a vertuous man, and fearing God, has advertiſed me that certaine perſons finde fault with the Order eſtabliſhed in our Churches; by the which, the Conſiſtories are ſubject unto Colloques, and the Colloques unto Provinciall Synods, and the Provinciall Synods, unto Nationall Synods: They would have every Conſiſtory to have an abſolute authority, and not to depend upon any ſuperiour Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: My Friend askes me thereupon my judgement; The thing is of ſuch a nature, and of ſuch weight, that I could not deny him his requeſt.</p>
            <p>I ſay then, That thoſe that make ſuch Propoſitions, ought not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: if men followed their advice, there could nothing follow but a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church upſide down, and an utter confuſion. It fals out often that two Paſtors of one and the ſame Church fall out amongſt themſelves, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the flock into two contrary Factions; in this caſe of neceſſity we muſt have recourſe unto a Company, and Power Superiour. But if the Church have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:121103:20"/>but one Paſtor, and he be a vicious man, and of a ſcandalous life, and be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the whole Conſiſtory, or that the Conſiſtory be divided, there is no remedie for this evil, but by Colloques, and Synods, that have power to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and Depoſe ſuch a Paſtor. There being but one Paſtor in this Church, and he deſerving to be depoſed, who is he that ſhall depoſe him? The Elders of the Conſiſtorie alone, Shall they pronounce Sentence of Depoſition againſt him? What if any one among the People be ſuſpended from the holy Supper, or excommunicated, To whom ſhall he have his recourſe to be received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the Church? And to whom ſhall he make his Complaint, if the Conſiſtorie, which hath unjuſtly condemned him, have an Independant, and irrefragable Authority?</p>
            <p>What if a new Hereſic be ſowen abroad, and that certaine Paſtors and Churches be infected with it? what means is there to meet with ſuch an evil, but by a Synode, that hath power to depoſe Paſtors that are obſtinate in their Error, and infect the Flocks? Had it not been for the Synod of <hi>Dordrecht,</hi> Arminianiſme had ſpread it ſelf over the whole country; If every Conſiſtory had been Independant, it had contemned the Deciſion of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; ſaying, We are not ſubject to any Synode; We have an abſolute and Independant Authority.</p>
            <p>Synods are chiefly buſied about hearing of the Complaints of particular Churches, and to judge of Appellations; If you deny that Power unto Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, they have no more to do; and their Convocation ſhall be to no uſe; for in vain ſhould they pronounce Iudgements, which were not in their power to put in Execution: Every Conſiſtory ſhould governe it ſelf after its own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; as if in a great Country one ſhould make of every Village a Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that were to introduce an Order, which ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles was never practiſed untill this time.</p>
            <p>There are many little Country Churches, whereof the Conſiſtory is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of one Paſtor, who is of no deep underſtanding, and of four or five Perſons, that are Elders of the Church; ſhall we give to ſuch a Church or Conſiſtory an Independant Authority? And that Paſtor hapning to die, theſe Perſons ſhall they have power to chooſe another? or give him Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Hands? Are they competent Judges of a Miniſters ſulficiency?</p>
            <p>What if becauſe of the Affliction of the Church, it be neceſſary to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate a Faſt throughout all the Churches of the Kingdom, who ſhall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine this Faſt? Who ſhall appoint the Day? If the Complaints of all the Churches muſt be repreſented to the Soveraigne Prince, who ſhall Depute? Who ſhall preſent the Requeſts of the whole Body of the Churches of the Kingdom?</p>
            <p>If for certain Emergent Occaſions, it be neceſſary to change ſomething in the Diſcipline of the Church, and to make new Ordinances to binde all the Churches, can that be done by Independant Conſiſtories, not ſubject to any generall Rule?</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:121103:20"/>
            <p> Briefly, we muſt hold conſtantly, that the Dependence of Inferiour Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, being ſubject to Superious, is the Band, that entertains the Union of the Church; which being cut aſunder, there ſhould be no more Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and we ſhould ſee a horrible confuſion: No man can be Iudge in his own Cauſe: If there be a ſtrife betwixt two particular Churches (as it fals out very often) not one of theſe Churches can be Iudge; They muſt addreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſome ſuperiour Authority.</p>
            <p>I will not believe, that theſe Independants have intelligence with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and that their Aime is, under colour of Reformation, to caſt us into a Confuſion, which might expoſe us to be laught at by thoſe, who are our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites: I would rather believe that they erre for want of Experience, and knowledge of that which is peſſible, and profitable for the Church of God.</p>

            <p>A Iourney that I was put upon by our Univerſity is the cauſe, why I had not anſwered ſooner thoſe Letters you were pleaſed to write unto me: I am much beholding to you, for the teſtimony of your Affection, and I pray you reciprocally to make account, you have mine. I cannot ſufficiently repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto you, how much we take to heart the confuſions of your Kingdom: Learneſtly wiſh that the Reformation of <hi>Scotland</hi> may be imitated by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that your Church-Government, as well as your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Aſſiſtance by Armes may be ſerviceable unto them. I doubt nothing, but firmely believe, that they that would introduce Independency of Churches, would bring in an Anarchie, a confuſion, and all ſorts of Licence to furniſh all Pulpits with men of Fanatick Spirits, as alſo your Churches with Schiſmes; I make no queſtion, but many of them are carried to theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a good meaning, that they think therein they do wel; But the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence of ſuch an Independence, ſhould it be eſtabliſhed, would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover more then we believe can ever ſufficiently be diſcovered, till it be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed: As many Altars ſhould you then have erected one againſt another as you have Churches; One Church would ſide it ſelfe with <hi>Paul,</hi> another with <hi>Cephas,</hi> a third with <hi>Apollos:</hi> God preſerve you from theſe horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, you ſhould ſee a <hi>ſweet Oconomie</hi> if every particular family ſhould, once come to be Independant without any Policy, or Dependance upon the publike; and what then would become of the poor Church of God; I ſhould have been much larger in handling the point more accurately: had I not thought it had been more expedient for you to have had the Iudgement of the Divines of this Univerſity jointly, being that it would have carried more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with it, then poſsibly any thing can do that proceeds from a private man onely. <gap reason="missing" extent="8 pages">

Independent,</hi> from which ye differ not, 1. they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, 2. they are Schiſmaticall, 3. and erected without the Civill Magiſtrates conſent; and ſuch Churches your ſelves hold unlawfull, turbulent, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall, and puniſhable, in <hi>N.E.</hi> And if in <hi>N.E.</hi> wherefore, I pray, not in old <hi>England</hi> alſo?</p>

It ſpeaketh only of their own, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:121103:22"/>this little Independent Miniſter is too bold to thinke himſelfe a competent Judge; Neither will they depend of him, howbeit he ſhould a ſpire to be as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, as <hi>Lucifer</hi> himſelf. 3. They ſpeak not of all their Magiſtrates, but of ſome, and eſpecially of thoſe who joyned with the Arminian Sect; The Arminians crying up their authority in the Spirituall government of the Church; and theſe unworthy Magiſtrates crying down the Doctrine. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Government of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Magiſtrates power there, is not like to that of <hi>England;</hi> the one being Monarchicall, or rather mixt of Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Ariſtocraticall, and Democraticall, as it is commonly holden here; and the other Ariſtocraticall, or mixt of Ariſtocracy, and Democracy: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rules of the one Government cannot be well drawn in conſequence for the other. 5. This <hi>M.S. cognomento Calumniator,</hi> in this matter, ſhould have done well, and gone more honeſtly to work, if he had cited thoſe <hi>high paſſages, ſo prejudiciall to our worthy Magiſtracy,</hi> but he ſhewes himſelfe more cunning, then ſo to diſcover his calumny. 6.

O witty and weighty Sentence, if any man underſtood it, worthy only ſuch an Eccleſiaſtes as himſelf to be Regiſter of What praiſe merite ye not both? <hi>Vunlo tu dignus, &amp; ille.</hi> In the the end of this <hi>ſect.</hi> he giveth out his metaphorical judgement, <hi>to grinde the Idol of half Reformation to powder;</hi> and yet profeſſeth, that he will not, (or which a man would rather beleeve,) cannot tell what it is. O how ridiculous a Judge is this without judgement. Only this I will ſay, that 1. if it be <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as this new <hi>Maſter of Sentences,</hi> &amp; <hi>C.C. ſay.</hi> 2. <hi>if an Idol that muſt be grinded into powder,</hi> as <hi>M.S.</hi> ſaith: and 3. if <hi>Epiſcopal Government</hi> muſt be <hi>extirpated,</hi> as the Covenant ſaith, and as we all in ſwearing the Covenant ſay, ſure then the <hi>Scots</hi> are come in upon very worſhipfull termes, to aſſiſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, <hi>viz.</hi> upon this Condition, that when they have fought for them, they ſhall extirpate them, and <hi>grinde</hi> them all <hi>into powder:</hi> Is not this a very quick Independent conception? and yet notwithſtanding all this (which is worthy the noting) theſe good men in taking the Covenant have ſworn the <hi>preſervation of the reformed Religion, in the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government, i.e.</hi> (according to their judgement) good Prelacy, or Epiſcopacy: <hi>jura, perjura.</hi> And here like a little Pope he telleth us, <hi>that all Churches generally, purtly by Tyranny, and partly by ſecurity are grown ſo corrupt, that to apologiſe for a through Reformation ſeems to reprove all, and ſo all

            <p>To his 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> I maintain, that Independents diſſent from all Chriſtian Churches, ſince no Chriſtian Church holds it ſelfe Independent but yours: and whether they be any Churches, that are not Proteſtant, we ſhall ſee in a particular Queſtion; howbeit it be an untruth, that ever I ſaid, that Papiſts were Chriſtian Churches: He and his fellows doe well to diſſent from Papiſts; but not in dependency: His Obſervations are falſe, where he ſayes, that we run to the <hi>Popiſh markes</hi> of <hi>viſibility, ſucceſſion,</hi> and <hi>univerſality:</hi> and I have refuted this calumny in my Anſwer to <hi>C.C.</hi> When I argue from <hi>viſibility,</hi> and <hi>number,</hi> I doe as the Apoſtle doth in bringing many viſible Saints, as a great number of witneſſes of our Doctrine, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and not as Eſſentiall markes of our Church. <hi>P.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>Becauſe I ſay that the Quinqu-Eccleſian Miniſters are but men, as I am, and that they may erre; out of this hee inferreth, that I thinke I have more knowledge then they, ſince they are not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Aſſembly. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the conſequence; for by the ſame reaſon, every particular man, that condemneth Anabaptiſme and other Schiſmes, and Hereſies, before they be condemned by the Synod, ſhould thinke themſelves learneder, then they are. But is it ſuch a crime to ſay that they are but men that may erre? I pray you ſir, if ye be any other thing then men, what are ye? if ye be men, who pretend ye cannot erre, you muſt either be <hi>Sancta Mater Eccleſia Romana,</hi> or els lead by Anabaptiſticall Enthuſiaſines, as with an <hi>ignis fatuus.</hi> And pretend ye that by reaſon of your great learning ye are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged from errour? I tell thee, man, that amongſt the very Angels, <hi>Lucifer;</hi> and amongſt men, <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of integrity, and ſince the Fall, <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> erred, and yet every one of them were learneder then ye all. I hope there is no man maketh the leaſt queſtion, but the meaneſt of them was learneder then any of you, yea then you all in <hi>cumulo.</hi> And therefore vaunt not ſo much of your learning; No learning, but <hi>viſio beatifica</hi> (which ye want) can priviledge a man from errour, according to Schoole-men.</p>

               <hi>P.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. I have anſwer'd, it is no Popiſh Argument, when I oppoſe ſo great a number of Witneſſes unto him; for then the Apoſtles Argument, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. ſhould be Popiſh: what is thy mopiſh argument I know not, for I never read mopiſh in the Index of my Bible, nor amongſt the termes of Divinity or Philoſophy: whether it be an injury or not, I know not, and care as little.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is an untruth to ſay, that <hi>I would conjure him to yeeld any thing upon plurality of voyces;</hi> for I have learned of ſome of his own party, that they are

He ſayes, that <hi>W.R.</hi> condemns the Apologiſts for agreeing with the Churches of <hi>N.E.</hi> and <hi>A.S.</hi> condemneth them for diſſenting from them; He ſhould have done well to have coted the places of our Books; and to have told at the ſame time in what points we condemne them, in their conſent and diſſent; for <hi>W.R.</hi> may condemne them for their conſent in one thing, and <hi>A.S.</hi> for their diſſent in another: If I condemne them for any diſſent, I may ſafely ſwear, that either I have read it in their Books, or heard it of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents themſelves: What I ſay <hi>p.</hi> 17. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. I ſay it again in my conſcience, that I verily beleeve that Independency cannot but prove the root of all Schiſmes and Hereſies; yea I adde, that by conſequence, it is much worſe then Popery. And all this I have ſufficiently proved in my Book, whereunto he anſwers nothing. And whereas he ſayes, I would do well to confer with ſome of them I write againſt, I had thought I had ſufficiently declared my readineſs in that kind formerly; and I again now declare unto you, Sir, in particular, that I deſire to confer with you, if I may know who you are; you ſhall herein do me a ſingular pleaſure, to teach me better; which if ye do not, or make me know, who ye are, I cannot think this counſell to be given in ſinceritie.</p>
            <p>Whereas I ſay, ye ſue for a Toleration, and conſequently for a Separation; it is moſt true, in the ſenſe, that I take a Separation, <hi>viz.</hi> for a Separation from our Diſcipline, and Sacramentall Communion, as I have fully proved in this my Book, whereunto all the Independent Churches in the world cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; for if ye be not ſeparated from us, but entertain union and communion with us, what need ye more a Toleration, rather then the reſt of the members of our Church?</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:121103:25"/>is true: and howbeit ye have not been yet accuſed before the Parliament, or the Aſſembly, yet doth not that juſtifie you, but highly commend their great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſingular prudence, and charity, in not taking notice of your indiſcretions (to ſay no more) in calumniating, nick-naming the Proteſtant Churches, and publiſhing unto the world ſuch unworthy Books againſt them, yea againſt thoſe, whom ye acknowledge for your Benefactors; Is not this I pray thee <hi>M.S. an undervaluing of ſo great favours?</hi> is not this an extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to ward the Churches of the Netherlands, who ſo lovingly received you, and cheriſhed you in the dayes of your affliction? Well, good men, if yee eſteem it not ſo, they both may think their favours to have bin very ill beſtowed upon ſo unthankfull men. But this <hi>M.S.</hi> and <hi>C.C.</hi> tell us, that they have done nothing, but by Ordinance of Parliament. What, wretched men, the very ſhame of this Kingdom, (I pray thee Reader pardon me, if I give them not the titles, that juſt anger would extort) dare ye in face of Parliament, and all the world ſo impudently father this indiſcreet Book, farced with little elſe, ſave Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, upon the two moſt honourable Houſes of Parliament? Have ye, I pray, any order from either of the Houſes to publiſh it unto the world?

            <p>Now in all theſe <hi>five Propoſitions,</hi> ſee, whether there be any ſuch thing, yea or not. As for the firſt which he imagineth to be <hi>contradictory</hi> to the next two. 1. They are all <hi>affirmative.</hi> 2. Never an <hi>one</hi> of them has the ſame <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</hi> 3.

The third <hi>Propoſition</hi> is not mine: In the 4. and 5. <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> which he calleth <hi>contradictory.</hi> 1. They are <hi>both affirmative.</hi> 2. The <hi>fifth</hi> is not mine, but falſly attributed by him unto me: So ſee, courteous Reader, whether, he has more reaſon to ſay of me; The man maketh nothing of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,</hi> or I, to ſay of him; This man, with the power of piety, maketh nothing of <hi>falſifications and lying.</hi>

I repent not my ſelfe at all, but thank my God that I have written againſt your Sect; And I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you, God willing, to continue all my life long ſo doing, if he call me not to ſome other employment, wherein I may glorifie him more.</p>
            <p>Only here, I pray thee Reader, to obſerve this mans vanity and madneſſe, who thinking it but a ſmall thing to offend me all along hitherto with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious Pen, has run out of the links to purſue His Majeſtie, becauſe of the name, which he hateth in my perſon; and therefore, that all the world may take notice of him, how couragious he is, he concludeth; <hi>All that I have to ſay to A.S. here is only to ſigh over this name S.

               <p>VVHether in any Eccleſiaſticall, or Politicall Aſſembly of the Chriſtian world, wherein things are carried by Plurality of voyces, it be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for any inconſiderable number of men to joyne in a particular combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation among themſelves, and therin to take particular Reſolutions, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them unto the world; and ſo to anticipate upon the Reſolutions of the whole Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>M.S.</hi> We have heard of ſome Parliaments <hi>in Europe,</hi> that the Houſe of Peers is ſo conſtitute, that if a Vote paſs, <hi>where</hi> ſom's Conſciences amongſt them cannot yeeld to, they may modeſtly enter in the <hi>Houſe their</hi> diſſent from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep. A.S.</hi> But your five Miniſters have not done ſo: there was no Vote at all paſſed, upon all the Articles, that are debated in their <hi>Apologeticall Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 2. And therefore neither <hi>entred</hi> they, nor could they <hi>enter</hi> their <hi>Vote of diſſent.</hi> 3. If the <hi>Houſe of Peers</hi> be ſo <hi>conſtitute,</hi> it followeth not, that the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> of <hi>Divines</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>conſtitute.</hi> 4. The Apologiſts have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with theſe <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Peers,</hi> or that are granted to any Parliament, or Synod men, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>enter modeſtly</hi> their <hi>diſſent from it,</hi> but they have gone further; for before that ever things were Voted, they publiſhed them to all the world. 5. They did it not <hi>modeſtly,</hi> but with great <hi>inſolence,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting over all Proteſtant Churches, as if they alone had the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> or as if they in their Churches had it in a higher degree, then all other Chriſtian Churches. 6. When the <hi>Peers</hi> do ſo, they doe it not as your Quinqu-Eccleſian Miniſters, <hi>viz.</hi> by Conventicling themſelves in ſecret, and a part, not impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:121103:27"/>their deſigne to their Brethren, and ſubſcribing an <hi>Apologie</hi> together. 7. If it was not to croſſe the <hi>proceeding</hi> and Diſputes of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> wherefore, I pray could it be? 8. Neither could it be to tell the Kingdome <hi>de facto,</hi> what they held and practiſed: 1. For if it be ſo, wherefore are they Petitioners in the laſt page of their Apology for a latitude and Toleration in Religion? 2. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore travaile they in all their Book, to refute the Presbyterian Government, received in the beſt Reformed Churches? 3. If you, Sir, can procure of your five Miniſters to ſweare, that what you ſay of them here is true, you may be better beleeved, then yet you are. 4. And I pray you tell us, if they have told you, that they had no other draught in all their Apologie, then what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare here. 5. If they affirme it in Conſcience, certainly their mind has not been like to their Book. 6. If it be ſo, what is the reaſon, that they declared not themſelves, before that they were Members of the Aſſembly, or before ſuch time as theſe matters were debated there? 7. I ask you whether, in that Book, they declare not, what was their opinion, and what they were reſolved to maintain. 8. And whether it was the duty of thoſe that were to be judged, before that ever matters were propounded or debated in their Aſſembly, to propound them and debate them themſelves before the people, before all the Water-men, Mid-wives, and children, yea, and the whole Kingdome? Was there ever any ſuch way taken in any Synod, or Aſſembly in this world before this time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> But they declare themſelves, <hi>to cloſe neerer with</hi> the Aſſembly, were <hi>they</hi> all <hi>Presbytortans</hi> (as we know <hi>the contrary</hi>) then thouſands ever <hi>thought they</hi> would.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> This is but your fiction; for if I ſhould tell you ſome mens judgement, &amp; mine own concerning you before the beginning of this Aſſembly, I muſt ſay wee never thought, that your Opinions could have been ſo abſurd, as we have fince found them in your Books: we beleeved, that ye were all to-gether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form with the reſt of the Proteſtant Churches; and that what ye did in ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your ſelves from Epiſcopall Government, it was meerly out of neceſſity, becauſe of their perſecution: And I can aſſure you, that this was the charitable conſtruction, that thouſands of the Scots, and French Proteſtants made of your proceedings. 2. This your pretended Fact, is grounded upon a Suppoſition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your knowledge, as you declare in your Parentheſis <hi>(as we know the contrary)</hi> and therefore is <hi>de ente poſſibili, non de actuali.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> they do profeſs themſelves <hi>ſo unwedded to their former prastiſes,</hi> that upon <hi>diſcovery of more light, they are moſt willing to let it in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> This is the common tone of all Sectaries; ſo did the Arminians ſay; would to God, that they and others of that Sect were ſo minded, and thought not it rather derogatorie to the honour of ſo Independent Spirits, to receive any light at all from others, whoſe Spirits are ſubject to the Spirits of the Prophets;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:121103:27"/>
                  <hi>But yee receive honour one from another,</hi> &amp;c. But all this is not ſatisfactory to my Queſtion, in this Obſervation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> Seeing all he has ſaid to be little or nothing to purpoſe, and not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to my Queſtion, he bringeth here his pretended <hi>Achilles,</hi> his main an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The Aſſembly is not, ſaith he, to conclude things by pluralitie of Votes, if you dare beleeve the Ordinance of parliament, whoſe words are, <hi>to confer, and treat touching Doctrine, Diſcipline,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and to deliver their Opinions and Advices, as ſhall be moſt agreeable to the word of God; And in caſe of difference of opinions among the ſaid Divines, they ſhall preſent the ſame, together with the Reaſons thereof, to the Houſes of Parliament.</hi> This taketh away in his conceit pluralitie of voyces, and doth more then allow ſo much, as is done in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologeticall Narration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> I deny, that the Aſſembly is not to conclude any thing by Plurality of Votes, for they conclude by Plurality of Votes, even thoſe Opinions and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, that they <hi>are to</hi> deliver to the Parliament; and if it were not ſo, they could not at all conclude their Opinions and Advices. 1. And as for the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> it commandeth one thing, <hi>viz. to conferre,</hi> &amp;c. but it forbiddeth not the other, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>conclude</hi> things by Plurality of Votes. 2. Howbeit it ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them, in ſome manner, to <hi>conclude</hi> ſome things by <hi>plurality</hi> of <hi>Votes,</hi> yet ſhould it not follow, that it forbiddeth them abſolutely, and altogether. 3. If any thing can be indirectly inferred of againſt <hi>concluding</hi> of things by <hi>pluraeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>voyces,</hi> it is only this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Aſſembly, in caſe of <hi>diſſent</hi> amongſt <hi>themſelves,</hi> ſhall <hi>conclude nothing,</hi> before that they <hi>preſent</hi> it, together with their <hi>Reaſons,</hi> to the <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament;</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe howſoever the Church may <hi>conclude</hi> things by <hi>Eccleſiaſticall authority,</hi> yet cannot her <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> make it to be received in the <hi>Kingdome</hi> by Law; and it is the Magiſtrates duty, before that he eſtabliſh it by Civill Authority, and make it to paſſe as a Law, that may oblige his Subjects <hi>in foro civili,</hi> that he firſt informe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe throughly, and know well, upon what ground he paſſes it: and this may be cleerly proved by the practice of the Primitive Church; for howſoever there the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> concluded many things by their <hi>Canons</hi> without <hi>civill Authority, in foro Eccleſiaſtico;</hi> yet the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate</hi> afterwards, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter due information, concluded the ſame things, <hi>in foro civili,</hi> as wee ſee through all the firſt 14. <hi>Titles,</hi> of the firſt Book of the <hi>Code.</hi> But out of this it cannot be inferred, that after they have delivered their Advices to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> they cannot <hi>conclude</hi> it, if they have the power of a Synod. 4. Yea I may ſay more, that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, in the firſt three hundred years after Chriſt, exerciſed this <hi>Authority</hi> againſt the <hi>Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates will, in foro Eccleſiaſtice.</hi> But, praiſed be God, our <hi>Miniſters</hi> have no cauſe to doe ſo. 5. Neither is it credible, even according to the Independents their own Tenets, that thoſe they hold to be <hi>Lay-men</hi> only ſhould by their <hi>lay-Authority</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:121103:28"/>build us up a <hi>Confeſſion of Faith, create,</hi> and <hi>depoſe Miniſters, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi> the <hi>power of the Keyes</hi> in <hi>Cenſures,</hi> and <hi>Excommunications,</hi> &amp;c. Neither read we of any <hi>Prince,</hi> or Civill Magiſtrate, that ever uſurped that power. Neither remember I any, that ever maintained it, beſides Sectaries. 6. Yee your ſelves will not admit them to be <hi>ruling Elders,</hi> how then admit ye them to bee <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Eccleſiasticall Judges,</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> and Spirituall <hi>matters, viz.</hi> in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Some will object, but what, if a <hi>Miniſters</hi> Conſcience cannot aſſent to that, which the <hi>Aſſemby</hi> paſſes by <hi>plurality Votes?</hi> in ſuch a caſe may he not <hi>oppoſe</hi> himſelfe to the reſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He may <hi>oppoſe</hi> himſelfe in <hi>reaſoning</hi> the buſineſſe all along till it come to be concluded by <hi>Plurality of Votes:</hi> but after that it is once <hi>concluded,</hi> he muſt <hi>in foro externo,</hi> according to Gods ordinary providence let it paſſe, yea ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto their Iudgements, for in ſuch a ſubſcription, he ſubſcribes not, that it is his particular judgement, or according to his private Conſcience; but that it is the publick Iudgement of the Aſſembly. 2. And if <hi>ye will</hi> oppoſe the whole Aſſembly, becauſe, that it is againſt your particular judgement, and Conſcience; ſo ſhall they all oppoſe you, ſilly man, and ſo nothing at all ſhall be concluded. 3. Yea, were it not, as I ſay, no Senate, no Councell, no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, no Eccleſiaſticall, or Politicall Aſſembly could ever conclude any thing; for very hardly will ye finde any, wherein ſome man doth not diſſent from the reſt. And finally, how ever one man in an Aſſembly, diſſenting from the reſt, might oppoſe the Iudgement, before it be given, or after the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for ſome ſcruple of Conſcience, which yet is not lawfull; yet might he not at any hand doe it, in writing of Apologies, againſt their Iudgement, much leſſe, before that they give out their Iudgement, and for feare they judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, then he would have them judge.</p>

All this Anſwer is only againſt a Syncategorema of my Obſervation, viz. <hi>this, where things are carried by Plurality of voyces,</hi> which aſſerts nothing at all, as all Logicians know; but nothing to the whole <hi>Demand,</hi> 11, Put the caſe, that this Syncategorema were omitted, yet this Interrogation ſhould ſtand in its full force; ſo as the Reader may ſee. 1. That this Pamphleters ayme is not ſo much to anſwer, as to elude this Demand. 2. That the Ordinance has nothing againſt Plurality of voyces. 3. That it juſtifies not your Apologiſts, being members of the Aſſembly, to publiſh Apologies, as they have done. 4 Much leſſe doth it, <hi>more then allow,</hi> ſo much as they have done; or if it doe, it ſhould conſequently allow all ſuch, as have the gift of writing, to fall upon you all, and pay you ſoundly.</p>

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:121103:28"/> 2. <hi>M.S.</hi> telleth us, that he utterly diſliketh my Conſequent, <hi>viz.</hi> that the five Miniſters quit the Aſſembly, and appeare, as parties: for then the worthy Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould likewiſe quit the Aſſembly, for, that they <hi>replyed</hi> to the Apologie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> 1. I know well, ye utterly miſlike my motion. 2. Neither believe I, that this Argument proceedeth of any great good-will ye have, that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould ſit in the Aſſembly. It may be ye wiſh them a faire wind to carry them home ſafe to their Countrey. 3. I deny your Conſequence, for it appeareth not, that they did reply to the Apologie: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name they the Apologiſts. 4. And howbeit they had written againſt them, yet ſhould it not follow; for they writ in defence of a Diſcipline, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy received in Proteſtant Churches, whereunto the Parliament and Synod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to conforme theirs. <hi>Item,</hi> of a Diſcipline, already approved by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> and no wayes condemned by any lawfull publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, either Civill or Eccleſiaſticall. 6. And againſt a new Sect, never as yet received or approved in this Iſland. 7. If that ſhould follow, it ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe follow, that all they, who did write againſt Antinomians, or in caſe any of the Divines of the Aſſembly ſhould write againſt Anabaptiſts, and other Hereticks, who ſhould be condemned by it, that they, in ſuch a caſe, ſhould quit the Aſſembly: but perchance you will deny the Conſequence. <hi>E.</hi> you muſt deny the Antecedent. 8. Forraigne Churches have complained to the Aſſembly of your Apologie, but not of the Reformation cleared; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Synod is bound in conſcience, either to avow and make good the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, or to cenſure and puniſh the Authors of it condignly, at leaſt if it be minded to entertain Brotherly correſpondence with them. It is not needfull to fill up my paper in obſerving of all this mans impertinencies, and abſurdities; this may ſuffice. Only I am ſorry that he ſhould ſo indiſcreetly defame his own Nation, under pretext of praiſing of our Commiſſioners: Sir, neither will the Commiſſioners, nor any Scots-man praiſe you for this: their honour conſiſteth not of other mens diſhonour; and this is ſufficient to make your Book to be condemned in quality of a Libell, if good men pitty you not: but whoever has to do with ſuch Spirits as yours, had need of much patience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> His third Conſideration, Whether ſuch an inconſiderable number in ſo doing may not be refuſed by the parties, as in competent Judges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> will needs have this Conſideration to <hi>vaniſh</hi> upon his anſwer to the firſt and ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> To that I reply, that ſince I have confirmed the two former, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth from them moſt neceſſarily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> 2. <hi>M.S.</hi> anſwers not this Conſideration, for that, as he ſayes, he had formerly anſwered it, the which is an handſome, but an ordinary evaſion, when men are at a non-plus, and know not what to ſay. How ſhould he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:121103:29"/>have anſwered it, conſidering that the Queſtion was not as yet ſo much as propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> in the two firſt Conſiderations? For they onely ſhew, that ſo ſmall, and inconſiderable a number ſhould not oppoſe themſelves to ſo great, and grave an Aſſembly, and that in caſe they doe it, they muſt quit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the office of Judges. But now the third ſhewes, that if they faile in this, the Aſſembly ought to eject them from being any longer of her Body, and take them for parties. Wherein the difference of this from the two former Conſiderations, is cleere and evident; and conſequently it is as cleete, that <hi>M.S.</hi> has anſwered nothing at all. But it ſeemes it is all one to him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that he can eſcape. And I wiſh he had done ſo throughout, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he had held his peace, then to haue made ſemblances, as though hee had anſwered, and ſo hud-winked his Reader. It had been fairer dealing by far, not to have ſpoken at all, then to have ſpoken ſo little to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> his fourth Conſideration. Whether this Apologeticall Narration was neceſſary, when you found the Calumnies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> begin by your preſence to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and vaniſh without ſpeaking a word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> anſwers, that theſe <hi>ſerene Spirits</hi> (oh abominable flattery!) <hi>were the Beames to ſcatter theſe myſts.</hi> But they begun onely, as he ſayes, to <hi>ſcatter</hi> them, and that therefore it was <hi>expedient,</hi> that they ſhould have written that Apologetick Narration to <hi>ſcatter</hi> them altogether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> Experience hath ſufficiently ſhewen the contrary; For their Writings were ſo farre from <hi>ſcattering</hi> thoſe <hi>miſts,</hi> that they have encreaſed them rather, and have evidenced it to all the world, that the conceit, that men had of their Opinions, was not <hi>Calumnies, Mistakes,</hi> or <hi>miſ-apprchenſions,</hi> (as they would faine have it beleeved) but an <hi>apprehenſion</hi> very well grounded; and moreover they plainly ſhew, that their opinions prove to be farre worſe, then ever wee thought.</p>
               <p>And admit, it ſhould have been <hi>expedient,</hi> they ſhould have written at the time thoſe <hi>miſts</hi> began to <hi>ſcatter,</hi> yet notwithſtanding, it ſhould have been more <hi>expedient,</hi> that they had written when the <hi>miſts</hi> were at the thickeſt, when there was no figne at all of <hi>ſcattering.</hi> One would have thought it had been more ſeaſonable, that they had written, whileſt they were <hi>under</hi> the <hi>cloud,</hi> then when they were now gotten out of it, Whilſt they were yet <hi>unjuſtified,</hi> then when they were already <hi>juſtified.</hi>

               <p>I ſpare him in his ſublime Conceptions, and paſs over his Proverb, which however it may a little poore Rhyme in it, has yet no reaſon, and ſerves as little for the purpoſe he brings it; as alſo in his Aſſinine Alluſion, of <hi>brayed,</hi> or <hi>breathed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little after, not content to have ſet upon me, he accuſes two learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, one an Engliſh man, another Scottiſh, that they have written to ſtirre up the people againſt the Independents.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:121103:29"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> In the ſame Conſideration ſaith; The honour the Parliament ſhewed you in calling you to be Members of the Aſſembly was ſufficient enough to juſtifie your perſons from all aſperſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> denies it, and pretends, that their private writings are more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and ſufficient, to perſwade the world of their innocent, then the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> For me, I believe, and take it for certain, that the publike Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Parliament is more authentique, then the particular writings of them, that are accuſed: yea, the very Election, and Admiſſion to the Synod by the Parliament ſuffice to juſtifie the Members from any publike accuſation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in matter of Doctrine, and Diſcipline; For ſure ſo Wiſe, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Parliament would never admit into a Synod, called together for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion, any Heretique or Schiſmatique, ſtained, and deformed with Errour. Notwithſtanding <hi>M.S.</hi> brings Reaſons for himſelfe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For that the Parliament being indulgent choſe Epiſcopall men. To which I anſwer, That the Biſhops at that time were Morally Orthodox, being not then accuſed, or condemned by any publike Authority. As to that he addes, that there are ſome Members of the Synod ejected out of the Aſſembly, and caſt into priſon; I anſwer, That this was for Delinquencies of theirs, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened after their Election; But for that the Independents were not ſo handled, they were held as Innocent men.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>M.S.</hi> ſayes, that two worthy Parliament men of a County may not know at firſt all the Faults in every Towne, <hi>&amp;c. A.S.</hi> To this I anſwer, that no more is there any neceſſity, that they ſhould know every particular man in a County. But it ſuffices, that they know two Miniſters, that are Religious, and of good report, and it ſhould be very ſtrange, if they ſhould not know ſuch a number. But beſides this I ſhall anſwer more fully in a particular Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</item>

               <p n="5">5. Conſideration, whether this your Apol. Narration, wherein ye blame all Proteſtant Churches, as not <hi>having the power of godlineſſe, and the Profeſſion thereof, with difference from all carnall and formall Chriſtians advanced and held forth amongſt them,</hi> as amongſt you, be ſeaſonable, when the Church of God in this Kingdome ſtands in need of their Brotherly Aſſiſtance; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of that of the Scots (againſt whom it is commonly thought to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly intended) who at this very time ſo unſeaſonable, according to their duty, hazard their lives, and eſtates for Gods Church, all this Kingdome, and you alſo.</p>
               <p>Here note, that <hi>M.S.</hi> anſwereth not to this principall Queſtion, or interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Prepoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> (if this Apologeticall Narration be ſeaſonable, when the Church of God in this Kingdome ſtands in need of the Brotherly aſſiſtance of Proteſtant Churches) but only biteth at the <hi>Syncategorema,</hi> or adjacent terme
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:121103:30"/>thereof, <hi>viz. not having the power of godlineſſe:</hi> ſo that his ſilence ſeemeth cleerly to grant the principall Queſtion, which we willingly accept of. As for the <hi>Syncategorema,</hi> it cannot receive the ſenſe, that hee puts upon it; for the Quinqu-Eccleſian Miniſters ſpeak here of themſelves, as <hi>contra</hi>-diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or oppoſed to all other Reformed Churches, both abroad, and within this Iſland, as appeareth by the beginning of the 2. <hi>Sect. p.</hi> 4. where they ſay, <hi>Wee were not engaged by education, or otherwiſe, to any other of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; And afterwards, we could not but ſuppoſe, that they could not ſee into all things about Worſhip and Government, their intentions being moſt ſpent</hi> (<hi>as alſo of our Reformers in</hi> England) <hi>upon the Reformation in Doctrine.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; <hi>And we had with many others obſerved, that although the exerciſe of that Government had been accompanied with more peace, yet the practicall part, the power of godlineſſe, and the profeſſion thereof, with difference from carnall and formall Chriſtians, had not been advanced, and held forth among them, as in this our own Iſland, as themſelves have generally acknowledged.</hi> Here they oppoſe themſelves, and thoſe of their own profeſſion, to all other Reformed Churches whatſoever, yea, to the firſt Reformers here in this Iſland, if <hi>England,</hi> whereof they ſpeak, be in this Iſland. It is likewiſe falſe; The words of the Apologie are; 1. <hi>That they, and many others had but obſerved touching the non-advance of the power of godlineſſe, &amp;c.</hi> They are <hi>verbatim</hi> as I have ſet them down: Neither cited I thoſe words, <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>among you,</hi> as the <hi>Quinqu-Eccleſian Miniſters</hi> words, ſince I put them in a different Character from theirs: and yet the ſenſe is moſt true, as I have proved: Neither ſaid I that they ſay, that other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had no power of godlineſs: Neither by this phraſe, <hi>This our Iſland,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand you, or can they underſtand any Reformed Churches, different in Government from themſelves, as this <hi>M.S.</hi> will perſwade us, unleſſe he hold our Reformers of <hi>England,</hi> to be out of this Iſland, ſince they oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all other Reformers, and Reformed Churches, both within, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Iſland. So if this ſpeech be intended againſt all other Reformed Churches, except their own, it muſt be intended againſt that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ye deny, good Sir, that of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be a Reformed Church: neither ſerveth it you a pin, that they call them deare Brethren, for that muſt either be by diſſimulation; or they conceive that men may be their deare Brethren, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the force of Piety; or they contradict themſelves; chooſe ye what pleaſe you, Sir. So this is not my ill eye, as you ſay, but your ill eye brought home to your own doore; fie upon thee, give glory to God, and render thy ſelfe to truth, for feare thou render thy ſelfe to worſe.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe falſe, that I ſaid, it is intended againſt <hi>Scotland;</hi> only I ſaid, it is commonly thought to be particularly intended againſt the Scots, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cleerly, becauſe ſundry Independent Miniſters, and others travell to prove it, by the confeſſion of ſome Scots Miniſters. So judge, I pray Chriſtian Reader,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:121103:30"/>whether this man with this his <hi>power of piety,</hi> or I, whom he maketh ſo impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Machivilian, ſpeak more like his Machiavilian? I am aſſured, what ever be thy power of Piety, thou haſt no practiſe of Piety here. No truer is it, that their Propoſition is but Indefinite in a Contingent matter, and therefore it may be conſtrued of ſome Particulars only; for as the reſt of the Independents ſave ordinarily their abſurd ſpeeches with meere Poſſibilities: ſo doth <hi>M.S.</hi> which here cannot hold, for, the Apologiſts ſay, that they were not engaged by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or any other wayes, to any other of the Reformed Churches. <hi>i.e. Nullo modo,</hi> and <hi>Nulli Eccleſiae Reformatae;</hi> ſo it is altogether Univerſall, both in regard of the Subject or Matter, and of the Manner; and of ſuch Churches they ſpeake, in all that Diſcourſe, in that Paragraph, and it may appeare by this their proofe, <hi>viz. as they themſelves generally acknowledge.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Conſid.</hi> Whether (as it is obſerved by ſundry men of learning, and as ye have noted your ſelves) ye ſhould not have done better, to have ſet down your Opinions by way of Theſes, and ſo manifeſted unto us, wherein ye agree, or diſagree with us, or from us, the Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, and thoſe, whom ye pretend to hold the ſame Tenets with you, in Old and New <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> then in a Rhetoricall, and Oratorious way, endeavour, in the moſt part of your Book, to publiſh your great Sufferings, and extraordinary Piety, and ſo to move us all to compaſſion, and raviſh us all into admiration, as if ye meant rather to perſwade, then to prove them?</p>
               <p>Hee anſwereth, that he cannot anſwer, ſince here is no ſence; And wherefore I pray? Becauſe the Interrogatory point is put after theſe words, <hi>or from us?</hi> Truly, As the word, <hi>agree,</hi> or <hi>differ may</hi> by a certain <hi>Figure</hi> in <hi>Grammar,</hi> called <hi>Zeugma,</hi> be underſtood to be joyned with all thoſe words, ſo is the point of Interrogation; But it ſhould bee at the end, as it is in the Obſervations; And whereas it is in the beginning in ſtead of a Comma, it is either the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters over-ſight, or mine. But to ſay, that this great learned Clerk could not perceive this, wherein the moſt ignorant findeth no difficulty, who can believe him? It is a pretty evaſion to elude my Queſtion. Whereas he ſaith that the Interrogation ſhould have been after Anabaptiſts as if the Reformed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who refute Browniſts and Anabaptiſts, ſhould ſay, we Browniſts and Anabaptiſts, it is but his foolery, which yet we could eaſily endure, if he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Queſtion; Which ſince he cannot do, I take it for granted, that in this they have not proceeded well, or at leaſt not ſo well as they might. If I ſhould ſerve my ſelfe of ſuch poore advantages, or ſhifts rather (as eaſily I might up and down in his, and <hi>C.C.</hi> Books) I ſhould anſwer nothing at all, as this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman does. But good men know, that when ever I doubt of ſence in them, what ever I do, I deale ingenuouſly with them, and conſult with ſundry to find out their meaning; and when neither others, nor I my ſelfe can find any ſenſe in their writings, I paſſe it over in ſilence, not reproving that which I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:121103:31"/>underſtand not, or that cannot be underſtood: But if others underſtood it, it is a great ſhame for this great Divine, to have been ſo dull.</p>

If they will anſwer, as I, we ſhall no more conteſt; They have gained me to them, if I have not gained them to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, Theſe Queſtions cannot reaſonably bee propounded to <hi>A.S.</hi> 1. for <hi>A.S.</hi> is no Sectary, neither Independent, Browniſt, Anabaptiſt, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> condemned, or rejected by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or any other well Reformed Church. 2.

The Parliament alloweth them not to ſhew their Reaſons a part, without imparting them firſt to the Aſſembly, and that without their Conſent. 5. Much leſſe to be Suitors for a Toleration, or allowance of their Sect: or if it allow them any ſuch thing, I would pray them to ſhew us an Ordinance for it. 6. What reaſon, that your extraordinary Sect ſhould have more allowance, then the reſt of the Synod? We pray you, in the name of God, to live as Brethren, <hi>more humane,</hi> as other mortall men, and if ye can or dare, to anſwer my Queſtions, as I doe yours.</p>

                  <hi>M.S.</hi> 5. A thouſand good Chriſtians were glad to heare, how the Five Miniſters diſſented from the rigid Separation, and cloſed with the beſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> Note here, that <hi>M.S.</hi> ſaith not that the five Miniſters diſſented from all the <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> but only from the <hi>rigid Separation.</hi> 2. They cloſe not with the beſt reformed Churches, unleſs by the beſt Reformed Churches be meant the Independent Churches. For he calls all our Churches in <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> Epiſcopall Churches, our Presbyteries, <hi>Idols</hi> that muſt be <hi>grinded.</hi> 3. Hee and his Partie diſſent not, in effect, from Separatiſts, in point of Separation in generall; for they ſeparate themſelves from our Diſcipline, and Sacramentall Communion, as well as they doe. 4. All this anſwereth not my Queſtions: I will not reply to his injuries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Perſon, for they touch not the Cauſe. Neither envie I him in ill doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> 8. <hi>Conſid.</hi> Whether ye deſire a Toleration for you Five alone, in your Religion; or for all the reſt. <hi>Item,</hi> If a Toleration, in publick, in erecting of Churches apart? or to live quietly, without troubling of the State? As for the laſt, appearingly, yee may have it unſought: but for the reſt, the Parliament is wiſe enough, and knoweth what is convenient for the Church of God, and the State. My Adverſary finds theſe Queſtions ſo newhat too hot for his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering, and therefore takes it for a point of Prudence, not to touch them, for feare to be burnt. Now then, that he may not ſeeme to have ſaid nothing, he falls to quarrelling with me about the ſignification of the word Toleration, and the Parliaments wiſedome, becauſe I ſay, <hi>It is wiſe enough, &amp;c.</hi> which he calleth a Contradiction to what I ſay afterward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S. Toleration,</hi> ſaith learned <hi>Cappell,</hi> is of things unlawfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S. Toleration</hi> or <hi>Toleratio</hi> in Latine has many ſignifications; 1. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken for <hi>Patience,</hi> and ſo it is an Act or integrant part of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> as <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the Schoole-men ſpeak. 2. Sometimes it ſignifieth a <hi>permiſſion</hi> of <hi>things,</hi> that we <hi>cannot mend; Toleranda ſunt quae emendari non poſſunt,</hi> And ſo the Magiſtrate tolerateth ſometimes many things againſt his Lawes, when he cannot make men obey. 3. Sometimes a <hi>permiſſion</hi> of things indifferent, that are <hi>not forbidden</hi> by <hi>Law.</hi> 4. <hi>Tolerabilia Tributa,</hi> in the Roman lawes, are <hi>moderate</hi> Tributes. <hi>Tolerabilia</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin, ſunt, quae vetus conſuetudo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat, Cal. in Lexico Juridico.</hi> And we have in <hi>Tacitus, tolerare vitam,</hi> which is not a thing unlawfull: So that <hi>Cappell,</hi> if he ſay ſo, appearingly, he ſpeaketh not of <hi>Toleration,</hi> in the whole latitude of its ſignification; for things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent may be tolerated.</p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>M.S.</hi> he ſayes, that he will not yeeld the one, nor beg the other. <hi>i. e.</hi> if I underſtand him, yeeld, that their Religion is unlawfull, or beg a Toleration: what then will he have? an allowance and approbation? will
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:121103:32"/>nothing content him, unleſs we confeſſe, that Independency is lawfull; and conſequently, that Dependency upon Councells and Synods is unlawfull? This is cloſe home; and ſo to content you, the whole State, and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches needs nothing els but that, without any further reaſon, they come hither and cry, <hi>peccavimus omnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other quarrell is my pretended Contradiction in theſe two Propoſitions; 1. The Parliament is wiſe enough, and knoweth what is convenient for the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Civill Magiſtrate arrogates not to himſelfe any directive power in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But tell me, my good Trifler, what Contradiction can there be here? Is not a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> an <hi>Oppoſition</hi> between <hi>two Propoſitions,</hi> the <hi>one Affirmative,</hi> the <hi>other Negative, both ſingular;</hi> or the <hi>one Univerſall,</hi> the <hi>other Particular,</hi> having <hi>both</hi> the <hi>ſame termes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now is there here the ſame <hi>termes, viz.</hi> the ſame <hi>Attribute</hi> in <hi>both</hi> theſe <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> are they <hi>both ſingular?</hi> or the <hi>one Univerſall,</hi> and the <hi>other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular?</hi> where are thy eyes? where is thy judgement? where is thy Logick?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Howbeit the Parliament be wiſe enough, and knoweth, what is convenient for the Church, will it follow, that the Parliament, and every Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate has a directive power, whereby Intrinſecally they may rule, and teach the Church, which is that, whereof I ſpake there? 3. By the ſame reaſon, any good Scholler, who liveth a private life, and knoweth what is convenient for the Church, ſhould have the like power. 3. Learne they here, that it is not ſimply <hi>wiſdome</hi> or <hi>knowledge,</hi> but Gods <hi>calling,</hi> that can give any ſuch <hi>power</hi> to any mortall man. 4. What if the Civill Magiſtrate were a Papiſt, or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Atheiſt, ſhould his bare knowledge give him any directive power over the Church? I cannot believe thee to be ſo abſurd, or wicked, as to ſay it.</p>
               <p>The reſt of his Diſcourſe here, is his ordinary injuries, and words of contempt againſt my perſon, which I ſleight and paſſe by as unworthy of an anſwer.</p>

                  <hi>A.S.</hi> 9. <hi>Conſid.</hi> And becauſe the whole draught of this Book tends evermore to a <hi>Toleration,</hi> and conſequently to ſome <hi>Separation.</hi> 1.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:121103:33"/>Separation, are not preſſed to be Actors in <hi>any thing</hi> againſt their conſciences) then to ſeparate themſelves from a <hi>Church,</hi> that teſtifieth a great <hi>deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme</hi> the defects pretended to be in it? 7. Whether it <hi>were not</hi> better for them, that aime at Toleration and Separation, to ſtay in <hi>the Church,</hi> and to joyn all their endeavours with their Brethren to reforme Abuſes, then by their Separation, to let the Church of God periſh in Abuſes? 8. Whether they doe not better, that ſtay in the Church to reforme it, when it may be reformed, then who quit it, for feare to be deformed in it?</p>
               <p>The Adverſary, to Elude theſe 8. Queſtions, telleth us, that they anſwer themſelves, and yet promiſeth an Anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> his firſt Anſwer is, that the <hi>Five Miniſters</hi> ayme at no <hi>ſeparation,</hi> but, as their <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> did, from <hi>Prelaticall coaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> If it be only from <hi>Prelaticall coaction,</hi> wherefore ſeparate they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their Brethren the Scots their Sacramentall Communion, and the Scots from theirs? if they ſeparate not themſelves from us, wherefore are they ſuitors for a <hi>Toleration,</hi> or approbation of <hi>their Religion,</hi> ſince ours is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>tolerated,</hi> and approved, as appeareth in the <hi>French, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Churches</hi> in this <hi>Kingdome?</hi> Neither are you compelled to be Actors in any thing againſt your Conſciences, as your Brethren were by Biſhops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> He ſaith the Church, from which the five Miniſters would ſeparate, teſtifies a great deſire to reforme Defects: yet ſaith he, thoſe Defects are but pretended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> Our meaning is to reforme Defects, if any there be, ſuch as we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be in manners, as amongſt you alſo: or in the adminiſtration of Diſcipline, as may be amongſt us all; But as for any Defects in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts of our Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, we ſee none as yet, that we travell not to reforme, but believe ſuch, as hee objects us in them, to be rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, then Reall: Neither can we, or ſhall we judge them to be any other thing but pretended, till he make it appeare, that they are Reall. Will He, that we beleeve them to be Reall, becauſe, that he only ſayes ſo? but it is not the firſt untruth has falne from his pen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> He would have the Five Miniſters quit the Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> This <hi>M.S.</hi> ſuppoſes, that this laſt Propoſition croſſeth my Suppoſition. But they may ſtay in the Church to reforme Abuſes, if there be any really, (as it is pretended by the Independents) and live out of the Aſſembly, as many others, who are no wayes their Inferiours. Neither ſaid I, that I wiſhed them to be out of the Aſſembly, only I propounded a queſtion; whether in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the publiſhing of their Apologie, they ſhould not reſolve themſelves to quit the Aſſembly?</p>

                  <hi>M. S.</hi> BLames me mightily for ſtating ſome Queſtions now in agitation in the Synod.</p>
               <p>To the contrary, I conceive, that herein I have done nothing amiſſe; But for the better ſtating and determining of this Queſtion we muſt obſerve:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are two ſorts of Queſtions, ſome that are already determined in Gods Word, and his Church alſo; Others that are not. 2. That there are ſome Determinations by publick Authority, as Lawes, Statutes, Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Canons, &amp;c. and others particular, proceeding of private or particular mens Iudgements; The firſt binds and obliges them, who are ſubject unto them: the ſecond cannot oblige any man to obedience; and ſo I ſay 1. That in Queſtions already determined in Gods Word by his Church, every man may determine, as God and the Church have determined.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe God obliges us to determine our <hi>judgements,</hi> according to the Determinations of his Word; eſpecially in things that are neceſſary to Salvation, for the very publication of the Goſpell obligeth us to aſſent.</item>
                  <item>2. If every man determineth not, according to Gods Word, he ſinneth.</item>
                  <item>3. If particular men determine not their Iudgement according to Gods Word, and becauſe the thing beleeved is conforme to Gods Word, it is not an Act of Divine Faith.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In theſe Determinations, according to the Word, I ſay that the Church Determination is publick, 1. Becauſe God hath endowed her with publick Authority, to determine according to the <hi>Determination</hi> of his <hi>Word.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe Iudges not by private authority, as private men. 3. Becauſe Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Lords Table, &amp;c. are not Acts of private but of publick Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and authority. This Authority of the Church is not Imperiall, or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall, but Miniſteriall, becauſe the Miniſters of the Church be nothing elſe but Gods Miniſters, or Servants, and not Lords in the Church.</p>
               <p>The Determinations, and Iudgements of particular Perſons are only parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and a Iudgement of Diſcretion. 1. Becauſe they proceed not from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but from private and particular perſons, even when they proceed from a Miniſter. 2. Becauſe they have not publick authority to oblige Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but themſelves alone. 3. Their principall and intrinſecall ayme is not to be directions for others, but for themſelves, and they doe not helpe to direct others in particular.</p>
               <p>This <hi>M. S.</hi> objecteth, that if <hi>A. S.</hi> determine it, he anticipates upon the Aſſemblies Iudgement; but that he muſt not doe ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the Conſequence; 1. for the Aſſemblies Iudgement is publick and mine particular. 2. It is already Iudged by the Church of this Kingdom
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:121103:35"/>that Presbyterian Diſcipline is not contrary to Gods Word; for if it were, it had never permitted it, to be practiſed or approved in England; as I have already ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the Minor I anſwer, That either by anticipating upon the Synods Iudgement, he underſtandeth an anticipation by a publick Iudgement, and that is impoſſible to me, for my Iudgement is not publick, but particular; or by a particular Iudgement, and then it is not properly an Anticipation; or if he will needs have it to be ſo I anſwer; that if I or any other Chriſtian have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any truth in Gods Word, we are all bound to determine our particular Iudgements according to it.</p>
               <p>Neither can the long Examination of buſineſſes in Synods, which proceedeth from Hereticks, Sectaries, and others their crafts, malice, or infirmities, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from determining the truths according to our particular Iudgements; for if it could, then whenſoever any Heretick ſhould ſtart up, and dogmatize againſt the firſt Articles of our Faith, denying Gods Infinity, Simplicity, Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Eternity, Immutability, his Wiſdome, Decrees, Power, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and his opinion were to be examined in a Synod, we muſt begin to doubt and ſuſpend our Iudgements, as ſo many Pyrrhonians about all thoſe points, which already we beleeved by Faith, and ſtand gaping for ſome new Determination of the Articles of our faith from Synods; And ſo Synods ſhould be moſt pernicious in making us to loſe our Faith, which before we had.</p>
               <p>In a word, we have received already the Determination and Reſolution of the Independents queſtions in Gods Word in other Proteſtant Churches, and the approbation of thoſe Determinations here by the Church of England. And the Diſcuſſion of them in the Synod, is not to change Gods Ordinance, but to give contentment unto weake Conſciences, if they can receive it.</p>
               <p>Again, If this Argument be ſtrong, I retort it againſt his Sect: If the Quinque Eccleſian Miniſters, <hi>M. S.</hi> and <hi>C. C.</hi> determine theſe Queſtions, as they doe in their printed Bookes here, and Sermons alſo, as we are credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they alſo anticipate upon the Aſſemblies Iudgement: But the Firſt is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo muſt the Second alſo be.</p>
               <p>Again, Either this man with the reſt of the Sectaries are minded to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce to the Determination of the Synod, or not: If the firſt, it is well, it is more then I expect of them, I pray God they deceive me: if not, what needeth he to ſight ſo much for the Determination of the Synod, which he is determined not to ſtand unto? would not this ſeeme to be ſaid in derifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Synod?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Obj. A. S.</hi> In determining the Queſtion, taketh it out of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the Conſequence, for it is in their hands by way of publick Authority, publicke Iudgement, and publicke Determination; Now <hi>A. S.</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:121103:35"/>or any other particular Determination taketh not away the publick, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Determination, Iudgement, or Authority.</p>
               <p>As for the ſtating of the Queſtion, this man will not permit me, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no particular man, ſo much as to ſtate it in particular, and that for the ſame reaſon: But if we may according to our particular Iudgement Determine it, how much more may we ſtate it, ſince it can no waiess be Determined, unleſſe firſt it be ſtated? Can the Synods ſtating and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the queſtion, free us of the obligation whereby we are bound to ſtate it, and Determine it according to Gods Word.</p>

                  <hi>QUEST. 4.</hi> Whether the Quinqu' Eccleſian Miniſters publiſh this their Apologeticall Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſeaſonably, yea or not, againſt M. S. p. <hi>24, 25.</hi> &amp;c. that affirmes it.</head>
               <p>I Maintaine the Negative part of the Queſtion; his Reaſons are; 1. Becauſe, before the publication thereof, the Calumnies, miſtakes, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions of their Opinions, and many of thoſe miſts that were gathered about them, or rather caſt upon their Perſons in their abſence, began by their preſence againe, and the bleſſing of God upon them, in a great meaſure to ſcatter and vaniſh, without ſpeaking a word for themſelves and cauſe, as the five Miniſters ſay in their Apologeticall Narration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> p. 24. of his Booke Anſwereth 1. That that <hi>ſcattering</hi> of <hi>miſts</hi> doth but relate to the people, and onely to ſome of them, viz. <hi>Thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe or pretend the power of godlineſſe,</hi> as appeareth by the precedent period.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> Reply 1. The precedent period hath no relation to this, for it endeth with a full point. 2. It is not the precedent period, that ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the ſubſequent, but rather the ſubſequent that ſhould ſerve for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to the precedent, unleſſe yee put the Explication before the Text. 3. Becauſe it is ſaid abſolutely. 4. They themſelves beleeve now at this preſent, that this relateth to others, as yee may ſee, p. 15. where they ſpeak of thoſe, who incited the State, not to allow them a peaceable practiſe of their Conſcience; and of ſome others, who did write Bookes againſt them, whom they accuſe alſo of <hi>miſ-apprehenſions,</hi> and <hi>miſtakes</hi> of their <hi>opinions.</hi> 5. Put the caſe it were ſo, yet was it not ſo ſeaſonable for them then to write, as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> Anſwereth 1. That many of theſe <hi>miſts</hi> and not all. 2, That they did but <hi>begin</hi> to <hi>ſcatter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> Iuſt, but it was not ſo ſeaſonable to write, when any of them, as when none of them begun to <hi>ſcatter,</hi> or after, as before they begun to <hi>ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> ſo to ſpeake <hi>Morally,</hi> that Apology was not ſeaſonable, ſince it was leſſe ſeaſonable, then it would have been formerly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> Their motions were like the lowrings of an unconſtant
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:121103:36"/>morning, in which the miſts aſcend, and anon deſcend, and by and by aſcend, and turne into a <hi>Scottiſh miſt, that will wet an Engliſh man to the skin,</hi> as our uſuall Proverb is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. This is but a Simile, <hi>Quod nil probat.</hi> 2. It is to be noted here, how he noteth this Proverbiall jeer of a <hi>Scottiſh miſt</hi> in a different ſort of letter, as conteyning ſome particular myſtery, and conſequently worthy of the Readers particular obſervation. 3. Yet I may ſay, that the Independent miſt is more able to drown all England, Scotland, and Ireland, then a Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh miſt the outward part of an Engliſh mans cloathes; and ſo will all true Engliſh, and Chriſtian hearts judge.</p>
               <p>If any thing have befallen you <hi>ſince the change of the time of your Exile (more imaginary then reall)</hi> it was your owne fault, in ſeducing the people, in a clanculary way, and in making of clandeſtine Aſſemblies and Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which good Miniſters could not endure, ſeeing that nothing could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you, unleſſe that all ſhould ſtoop under you.</p>
               <p>Neither hath your Apology any waies diminiſhed any ill, but rather ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the good opinion they had of you.</p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>M. S.</hi> accuſeth not only the people, but alſo Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Herle,</hi> and ſundry other Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> S. his ſecond reaſon is, They who are called by the Parliament, and admitted by the Aſſembly of Divines into the Aſſembly (howſoever that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was to finde them good, and not to make them ſo) are ſuppoſed by them to be innocent, and not culpable (and eſpecially after that they have ſate long in the Aſſembly of Divines, with honour and good reſpect) and conſequently they are ſufficiently vindicated from all falſe Accuſations, and have no need to Apologize for themſelves, that being farre away more ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to juſtifie them before the world, then any Apology whatſoever, that they can write for themſelves.</p>
               <p>But the Apologiſts were ſo called, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſenſe, and forme by me intended of my Argument in the fourth Obſervation, and not that that <hi>M.</hi> S. putteth upon it.</p>
               <p>As for his inſtance of the Biſhops againſt the firſt Propoſition, that they were called by the Parliament to the Aſſembly, and yet they were not for all that ſuppoſed to be innocent, or vindicated, I Anſwer 1. That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were not admitted into the Aſſembly of Divines, as they were. 2. If they had been admitted, and continued as long as they, without reproach, how can any doubt but that their ſitting there ſhould have ſerved them for a ſufficient juſtification and vindification of their honour, in <hi>foro externo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, ſince it is not morally to be preſumed, that ſuch a grave Senate will call, or ſuch a holy Aſſembly of ſuch Learned and Reverend Divines will admit and retaine ſo long together any ſcandalous perſons in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; So this being <hi>teſtimonium alienum, non proprium,</hi> and <hi>publicum non
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:121103:36"/>privatum,</hi> without all doubt it was ſufficient to juſtifie them, and more then any thing they can ſay in their owne behalfe; ſince they cannot ſpeake as Iudges, but as Parties, who are evermore juſtly ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 3. Reaſon. He, or they, who are ſent by authority of Parliament into Scotland, with the Parliaments Commiſſioners, to treat of an extraordinary great Reformation of Religion in England and Ireland, &amp; for the preſervation of the Religion in Scotland, in bringing them all to uniformity according to Gods Word, and the Example of the beſt Reformed. Churches, and have ended the buſineſſe with them, are not morally to be preſumed, to be culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but ſufficiently freed from all filthy aſperſions, in matter of Religion, that can have been laid upon them, at leaſt in <hi>foro externo,</hi> wherein only they can be juſtified by men in this life; for it is not Morally to be preſumed, that the Parliament would have imployed any, but Orthodox men, and good men in a matter of ſo high a concernment, and conſequently they needed not to Apologize for themſelves, or if they doe ſo, it was unſeaſonably done. But the Apologizers are ſuch men.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, only one of them was ſuch a man:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is all one; 1. For in matter of Religion, they lye all under one and the ſame notion. 2. At leaſt that one needed not to Apologize as he did.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe, being minded to make an Apology, they ſhould either not have made it at all, being Members' of the Aſſembly; or have done it before their Admittance thereunto, or after the Diſſolving of the Aſſembly. This had been a great deale more ſeaſonable; for it is not fit for a man, to Apologize for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a cauſe, wherein he ſitteth as Iudge, or when he ſitteth as Iudge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We can finde no ordinary Example of ſuch proceedings, either in Scripture or Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Becauſe they did it in a ſeaſon, when the Church &amp; State ſtood in need of the Brotherly aſſiſtance of all the beſt reformed Churches; and in that very nick of time, they under-valued them all, as not having the power of Piety, as they themſelves; cenſured their Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, as not agreeable unto Gods Word, and called them Calvinians; whereof we have a ſufficient proofe, in a Letter ſent to the Aſſembly, from the Synod of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachria, wherein it complaineth much againſt this Booke, becauſe of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that the Reformed Churches received thereby.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Becauſe it was publiſhed againſt the Scots Diſcipline in that very nick of time, moſt unſeaſonable, when they were invited to come into England, and when they came to hazard their lives for the Church and State of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and for the lives and ſtates of theſe very men, who in the meane while were writing againſt their Diſcipline.</p>

               <p>IMaintaine the Affirmative part; 1. Becauſe that of all other, is the moſt accurate, and eaſieſt way, to manifeſt cleerly their Opinions by, both to the learned and ignorant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe all other waies of teaching beget confuſion; for in them we cannot diſcerne that which is Subſtantiall, from that which is Circumſtantiall; as we may ſee in Comedies, Tragedies, all ſort of Verſes, long Speeches, Prayers, Dialogues, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>C. <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>M. S.</hi> deny it.</p>
               <p>By Anabaptiſts I underſtand not all ſort of Anabaptiſts, as thoſe, that be alſo Arminians and Socinians, but thoſe who differ from them only in delaying and reiterating of Baptiſme (as the word it ſelfe implyeth) who are very many in number, and make up the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Sect amongſt them here in London, and in other parts of England; for this Propoſition is Indefinite and in a contingent matter, which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

               <p>And the Queſtion being ſtated, I maintain the Affirmative part; 1. becauſe they differ only in this one point; neither can any of theſe two Divines, viz. <hi>M. S.</hi> or <hi>C. C.</hi> ſhew me any further difference.</p>

For how can he be a member of the Church who is not yet in <hi>Rerum natura?</hi> 2. By the ſame reaſon, the Church ſhould have been actually before the Creation of the world, and before ſhe was created, from all eternity; for God <hi>elected</hi> his Church, from all eternity: 3. Men of age ſhould be actually members of Chriſts Church without Faith; for they have not actually Faith by <hi>Election,</hi> but by their efficacious <hi>Vocation.</hi> 4. And howſoever the Decree of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> or <hi>Election,</hi> be requiſite, and be the firſt cauſe of the Church, and of all the members thereof, and it being put, all the ſecond Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes muſt needs be: yet makes it not them to be, when it is its ſelf, but in their own time and in due ſeaſon, when it is put in execution by ſome externall act of Gods Almighties power, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> can not be eternal, as his Decree; but temporal. 5. Becauſe Gods Church is an Houſe, a Family, and a City, which can not be built of ſtones, that are not, or compoſed of Domeſticks, and Citizens, that are not in this world. 6. A man cannot be the Brother of Chriſt and member of his church, before he be regenerate, or born againe, how much leſſe, before he be generated, or born; unleſſe ye will ſay, that he may have his ſecond birth or generation before he have the firſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of this naturall eſtate, &amp;c.</hi> here is expreſſed <hi>Terminus a quo, et ad quem,</hi> from whence, and whereunto the Church, or the members thereof are called; <hi>Terminus a quo,</hi> or from whence, is from the eſtate of Nature pure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, not incorruptible as was that of the Angels, and of man before his Fall: or of corrupt nature, ſuch as hath been that of mankinde ſince their Fal. <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> or whereunto they are called, or which can intend, is Grace in this life, and ſupernaturall Glory in that to come.</p>
               <p>By <hi>ſupernaturall Glory</hi> muſt be underſtood <hi>ſupernaturall Beatitude,</hi> or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which is the laſt aym, their <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> or greateſt good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whereunto they tend, or which they can intend: And this, in reſpect of entire and pure or immaculate Nature, is abſolutely called <hi>Beatitude</hi> or <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city:</hi> but in regard of corrupt Nature, <hi>Salvation;</hi> for it is not a man without ſin, as Chriſt, or Angels that never ſinned, but <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; his poſterity, that are ſaid to be ſaved from their ſins, and miſery whereunto by ſin they are ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Means</hi> are called <hi>convenient,</hi> when they are fit to effect that which by them is intended; ſuch in reſpect of Angels was the Law of Nature, printed in their Underſtanding, anſwerable to their ſpirituall Nature;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:121103:39"/>ſome Supernatural Precepts alſo, for they were bound to beleeve the <hi>Trinitie:</hi> anſwerable in <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall was the Law, and ſuch reſpect to the ſpirituall and corporall nature, whereof he was compounded, as the Morall Law, and ſome ſupernaturall Precepts to beleeve the Trinity, &amp;c. proportionate to the end and aym, viz. ſupernaturall glory, whereunto he ſhould tend, and which he ſhould intend; And in regard of all mankind ſince our Fall, is the Covenant of Grace, and the means to fulfill it, as Faith, Hope, and Charity.</p>
               <p>The Church in this vaſt and large ſignification contains 1. in it ſelf the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels, 1. becauſe the Scripture ſayes ſo, Heb. 12.22, 23. 1 Pet. 1.12. 2. becauſe they are our Fellow-ſervants and our Brethren, Apoc. 19.10. and 22.9. &amp; they belong to one ſociety with us, 3. becauſe the Angels are our Con-diſciples in ſtudying the Goſpel with us. 1 Pet. 1.12. 4. Becauſe they are Subjects with us of one Celeſtiall Republike, and Citizens of one Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all City: 5. Becauſe we aſpire to the ſame Beatitude and Felicity with them, viz. to the viſion of Gods face, and ardent Charity: 6. Becauſe, in reſpect of our ſpirituall part, and the Faculties thereof, our Intellect and Will, we are capable of the ſame union with God. 7. Becauſe Chriſt is head of the Angels; as well as of Men, Col. 2.19. Eph. 4.15.8. Becauſe he is their Creator, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator, Mediator. God <hi>gathered in one, all things in Chriſt,</hi> both which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth, and every thing in them, Eph. 1.10.9. Becauſe the Angels <hi>adore</hi> Chriſt, Hebr. 1.6.10. Becauſe all things, yea, the Angels are ſubject to Chriſt, Hebr. 1.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It contains men in Heaven and in Earth; for the Church in Earth and in Heaven differ onely, as a man travelling, and one arrived to his Port or home. All theſe that are, or ſhall be ſaved, thoſe that are already born, and to be born; regenerate, or to be regenerate, howſoever they that are not yet born, or regenerate, be not actually members of the Church, till they be born and regenerated.</p>
               <p>This Church in regard of its <hi>materiall parts, integrity,</hi> and quantity, may be diſtinguiſhed, 1. into the Catholike or univerſall, and particular Church.</p>
               <p>The Catholike Church is that, which before <hi>we defined,</hi> compoſed of all the Elect, Angels and Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again it is to be obſerved in paſſing of this Word, <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> that it is not a term of Scripture; nor was any man called a Catholike in the Apoſtles time, if we beleeve <hi>Pacianus</hi> epiſt. 1. <hi>Ad Sempronianum;</hi> neither in their time was the Chriſtian Faith ſpread Catholikely, or Univerſally through all the World: and hence many Proteſtants infer, that the Creed, I mean that of the Apoſtles, was not framed by them: Nevertheleſſe we have ſome terms in Scripture equivalent unto it, as that of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and by the Schoolmen, <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> is diſtributed by Chriſt unto ſome of her members, not ſo much for their own, as for other mens uſe and ſalvation to be a <hi>corpus heterogeneum diſſimilare,</hi> an Organicall Body compoſed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of different names and natures one from another, and from the whole Body having different functions, and operations, as of prophecy, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of Miracles &amp;c. as a man of his head, legs, and arms, whereof the one is not of like nature or like name with an other, or with the man; for the leg is not the head, nor a man as the Apoſtle declares: nevertheleſſe in regard of her ſpirituall and ſaving gifts, as Faith, Hope, Charity, &amp;c. wherein conſiſts her <hi>intrinſecall form,</hi> conferred upon the Elect, for their own uſe, otherwayes called by Schoolmen, <hi>gratia gratum faciens,</hi> Grace that makes us acceptable to God it is <hi>totum homogeneum,</hi> or <hi>ſimilare,</hi> a ſimilary Body, Compoſed of the like parts, whereof every one hath the ſame name, and nature one with another, and with the whole Body; for all the members of Chriſt have the like Faith, inclining to the like Acts of Beleef; the ſame Myſteries; and a like Charity, inclining to the like Acts of love to all men, and eſpecially to the Houſhold of Faith: So every particular Church is a Church, one as another, and as the univerſall Church, I ſpeak here of the redeemed Church; for the Church of Angels, and of men, before their Fall, be not parts <hi>homogeneall,</hi> with the redeemed Church, becauſe of their <hi>diſſimulary</hi> Covenant, and <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall formes</hi> and vertues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> the Church may be denominated univerſall, in regard of her <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall</hi> and <hi>accidentall forme,</hi> conſiſting 1. in the externall profeſſion of her intrinſecall Chriſtian vertues, by confeſſion of her Faith, Hope, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Charity, and holineſſe of life. 2. In her participation of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according to Gods Word. 3. In her extrinſecall ſound Diſcipline, and Government, which ſhould be in every Church. Againe, the Church may be univerſall, in reſpect of ſome Circumſtances, viz. of <hi>time, place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> and <hi>Ages;</hi> 1. of <hi>time,</hi> becauſe the Chriſtian Church from her firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution by Chriſt till the end of the world ſhall never decay; 2. of <hi>place,</hi> not <hi>poſitively,</hi> as if it were in all <hi>places,</hi> but <hi>negatively,</hi> becauſe it is not <hi>excluded</hi> from any <hi>place,</hi> as that of the old Teſtament, limited within the confines of the Holy Land, but ſpread through all the world, Pſal. 19.5. Mat. 26.13. Col. 1.6.3. of <hi>Perſons</hi> of all Ages, Sects and Conditions, for no man is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Goſpell; neither Iew, nor Greeke; neither Servant, nor Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; neither Male, nor Female, Gal. 3.28.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it may be diſtinguiſhed according to her materiall, or integrant parts, into the Church of Angels, and of men: But the Scripture has very little of that of the Angels, ſo as we may let it paſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:121103:40"/> 3. That of men may be diſtinguiſhed according to the ſtate, and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof into that, which is <hi>Militant</hi> here on earth, fighting againſt Sathan, and Triumphant and victorious in Heaven, reigning eternally with God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Militant,</hi> according to the ſtate thereof and Covenant, is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into that, which was before the Fall, &amp; that after the Fall: The Church before the Fall was compoſed of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> alone, and governed by the Law of Nature, and ſome ſupernaturall Precepts: and called to ſupernaturall felicity, I ſay compoſed of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> alone, viz. actually; for howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever before the creation of <hi>Eve,</hi> God or Chriſt was his head; yet could he not be his Head as of a Church, 1. For a Church is a company not of the Head and one member, but of the Head and many members, Rom. 12.5. Eph. 1.22, 23.2. Becauſe before the Creation of the Woman, there was no ſymbolicall Law, nor Sacraments of the Covenant, ordained by God, as the Tree of Life. 3. Becauſe the Church, is a Family, a City, a Kingdome, which cannot conſiſt of one member, Col. 1.13. Rom. 14.17. 1 Tim. 3.15. Apo. 21.2. Matth. 13.11. Item a body compoſed of ſundry members, 1 Cor. 12. a flocke, 1 Pet. 5.2. which is not compoſed of one ſheep; yea, after the Creation of <hi>Eve,</hi> it was not a perfect or compleat Church: but in <hi>fieri,</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to perfection, by the propagation of mankind, and perfected in its <hi>fieri</hi> when it was breeding; for to a perfect Church, is requiſite a Ruler or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; and ſome to be ruled, and not one alone. 2. Becauſe the Church is a Society, like to that of a Kingdom, or a City, which can not conſiſt of two perſons only. 3. Becauſe howſoever three may compound a Colledge, yet can they not make up an Eccleſiaſticall, or politicall Society. 4. Becauſe in a Church there muſt be power of Excommunication, which cannot ſubſiſt in two; for if the one ſhould Excommunicate the other, the Church ſhould periſh, which is repugnant to the <hi>nature</hi> of Excommunication, which is not given to the <hi>destruction</hi> but to the <hi>conſervation</hi> of the Church, 1 Cor. 5. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was imperfect in its ayme, in reſpect of man, for it brought no man to felicity or glory. 6. Becauſe to every Reall Church correſpond ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Church, which is a ſign of the Reall, and not altogether the ſame, but there could be no repreſentative Church before the Fall, correſpondent to it, different from it ſelfe, becauſe theſe were but two perſons not differing from themſelves, notwithſtanding it might have been repreſented by an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, but not by a Church.</p>
               <p>The Militant Church after the fall is that, which is redeemed by Chriſt, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in him, to the forgiveneſſe of their ſins, and eternall Glory.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This in regard of time and ſtate is either before Chriſt, as that of the Old Teſtament, wherein Chriſt was obſcurely revealed, or of the New, ſince his comming, wherein he is more cleerly revealed, which for this cauſe is called the Chriſtian Church; partly becauſe it is ſince Chriſt, partly becauſe Chriſt is more viſibly revealed unto her; partly becauſe he in Perſon revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:121103:40"/>himſelfe and his Goſpel, for <hi>the Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace was given by Ieſus Christ, Iohn</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>The particular Church is only a part of the Univerſall or totall Church; And as the univerſall is univerſall, 1. In regard of <hi>Time,</hi> which comprehends all the Churches of all times. 2. Of <hi>place,</hi> which comprehends the Churches of all places, or through all the world. 3. Or of <hi>Perſons,</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all forts of perſons: ſo the particular, is either 1. in regard of <hi>time,</hi> which only comprehends in its ſelfe, the Churches of a certaine <hi>time,</hi> as that of the Old Teſtament, which was before the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh; and that of the New, which is ſince his comming: So we call the <hi>Church, Primitive,</hi> that which was before our <hi>times,</hi> immediatly after Chriſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and ſome time after. 2. Or in regard of <hi>places,</hi> as when we ſay, that a Church is Nationall, which is in one Kingdome or Republick; Provinciall, that is in one Province; and Parochiall, which is confined within the limits of one Pariſh. 3. Or in regard of <hi>Perſons,</hi> which comprehends a certaine number of perſons, of one or divers <hi>places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it is to be obſerved; 1. That the Church may be denominated uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, or particular, either abſolutely, or reſpectively in relation to another bigger or leſſe: ſo Abſolutely the univerſall Church comprehends in its ſelfe all the Churches of all <hi>times;</hi> of all places; of all forts of <hi>Perſons, Angels</hi> and <hi>men;</hi> of all Eſtates, or conditions and Covenants; As that in the Covenant of integrity; <hi>naturall,</hi> or <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> as of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>men</hi> before their Fall, and that in the ſtate of ſin under the Covenant of Grace; and in the ſtate of Glory. And according to this conſideration, the Church of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, is one particular Church; That of Mankind, another; The Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and Militant, two others; and in a word, all the parts thereof, may be called particular Churches.</p>
               <p>Reſpectively the Church of Mankind, is an univerſall Church, in reſpect of its parts, as of that before and after the Fall; the Triumphant and Militant: ſo the Church after the Fall, is univerſall in reſpect of that of the Old and New Teſtament, which be its parts: and the Chriſtian in reſpect of its parts in Heaven and on Earth; of the Primitive, and that of ſubſequent times: that which is in all the world in reſpect of its parts, in divers Kingdomes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, &amp;c. But that which is moſt to the purpoſe in this our Diſcourſe, is the Catholick Chriſtian Church here upon earth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Againe, the <hi>Militant Church</hi> (whether ſhe be conſidered, according to her univerſality and totality, or particularity in her ſeverall parts, and Aſſemblies) in reſpect of her internall and externall forme, is either <hi>viſible,</hi> or <hi>inviſible.</hi> The <hi>inviſible Church</hi> is that which cannot be ſeene, but only is beleeved by Faith. The <hi>viſible</hi> is that which we ſee or behold; where it is to be obſerved: 1. That the word <hi>viſible,</hi> is not to be taken here ſtrictly, for the object of the ſight alone, or the word, <hi>ſee,</hi> or <hi>behold;</hi> for the <hi>act</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:121103:41"/>thereof; but in a more full ſignification, for that which any waies is percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible by the eye, or any externall, or internall Senſe, or by naturall Reaſon; ſuch as are the confeſſion and profeſſion of Chriſtian vertues, the exerciſe of their externall Acts; whereof ſome be apprehended by the <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>Eye,</hi> as the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Charity;</hi> ſome by the <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>Eare,</hi> as the confeſſion of <hi>Faith;</hi> ſome by <hi>feeling,</hi> as the aſſiſtance and attendance upon the Sicke; ſome by the <hi>internall Senſes;</hi> ſome by Act of Reaſon only: and the reaſon of this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word <hi>viſible</hi> muſt ſignifie all that, which, is denyed by <hi>inviſible;</hi> now <hi>inviſible</hi> ſignifies a <hi>negation</hi> of all, that can be apprehended by any Senſe, or Act of Reaſon, <hi>Ergo</hi> the word <hi>viſible</hi> muſt ſignifie that, which can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by any Senſe or Act of Reaſon, ſo that it belong to the Externall Form of the Church, which repreſents the internall <hi>Forme</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſides that, it is here to be obſerved, that the <hi>viſible Church</hi> of it ſelf is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore <hi>viſible</hi> and conſpicuous, but by Accident becomes ſometimes <hi>inviſible,</hi> latent, obſcure, and unſeene; and that 1. either becauſe of the perſecution Shee ſuffers by her enemies, when Shee hides her ſelfe in the Wilderneſſe; or 2. by reaſon of her ſlitting from one place to another, as when Shee went from <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to <hi>Pella;</hi> or 3. becauſe of the weakneſſe of the <hi>ſight</hi> of the Seer, as in <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 King. 9. verſe 4. for want of ſight, as to thoſe, to whom, as the Goſpel, ſo the Church profeſſing the Goſpell, is hid and <hi>inviſible,</hi> 2 Cor. 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Finally, It is not to be omitted, that this is not a Diviſion of the Churchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two <hi>Species,</hi> or two <hi>integrant parts,</hi> or any waies into <hi>parts really,</hi> but <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally distinguiſhed;</hi> For a <hi>Church</hi> altogether <hi>one,</hi> in the ſame <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> and according to the ſame <hi>parts</hi> may be, howſoever according to divers conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, and Formes, which be the grounds of divers conſiderations, it may be <hi>Viſible</hi> and <hi>Inviſible,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which is <hi>viſible</hi> in reſpect of her <hi>externall forme, viz. Confeſſion</hi> of the true Chriſtian Faith, the <hi>profeſſion</hi> thereof and other chriſtian vertues; Item in reſpect of her <hi>Diſcipline, &amp;c.</hi> And the ſame Church in reſpect of her <hi>internall Forme,</hi> viz. Faith, Hope, Charity, the Spirit of Chriſt, &amp;c: which be ſpirituall qualities altogether <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,</hi> in the ſenſe before declared, is altogether <hi>inviſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Militant Church,</hi> both in her <hi>totality,</hi> and <hi>partiality,</hi> may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two integrant parts, viz. into the <hi>Over-ſeers,</hi> that <hi>preach, teach, rule, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Flock,</hi> which is over-ſeene: And they be the two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts, concurring to its integrity, without the which it cannot be a totall or whole <hi>viſible</hi> Church: and therefore a Church without <hi>Oversſeers</hi> is not a whole <hi>viſible Church:</hi> I ſay a <hi>whole</hi> or <hi>totall</hi> Church; for without Paſtors it may be a <hi>totum eſſentiale, i.e.</hi> eſſentially a Church, for <hi>Paſtors</hi> are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for the <hi>eſſence,</hi> but for the <hi>integrity</hi> of a <hi>Church.</hi> Item, I ſay without <hi>Over-ſeers;</hi> 1. All <hi>Over-ſeers,</hi> for it may be, that a Church may ſubſiſt without Paſtors alone, or Doctoss alone, or Rulers or Elders alone; or Deacons alone, but not without all.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:121103:41"/> 8. The Militant <hi>viſible</hi> Church, whether it be conceived in its <hi>univerſality</hi> and <hi>totality,</hi> or in its <hi>particularity</hi> in ſeverall Congregations, is either <hi>Reall,</hi> or <hi>Repreſentative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Reall Militant</hi> Church is any <hi>viſible</hi> Church here upon Earth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of all its <hi>reall Profeſſors</hi> of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The Repreſentative Church, is an Aſſembly of certaine Perſons, or Church-Officers, in an Eccleſiaſticall Iudicatory, choſen out of the whole Body of the Reall Church, to repreſent it, as it is; ſuch be the Seſſions, or Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Synods, Provinciall, and Nationall.</p>
               <p>As for the Reall viſible Church, ſome thinke that it is very probable, that it is never altogether without Iuſtifying Faith: but it is probable, that where there be very ſmall Congregations of ſeven or eight perſons, they may be all without Faith, and eſpecially, where the <hi>Church</hi> is corrupt, or where the <hi>Members</hi> are all vicious and diſſolute: Their conjecture will hold more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, in great Congregations, in Provinciall, and Nationall Churches. But in a <hi>Repreſentative</hi> Church, compoſed of very few Church-Officers, it is very probable, that ſometimes, they may all be without Faith, howſoever they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a Church of Reall Beleevers; for to repreſent Reall Beleevers, it is not abſolutely neceſſary, that they, that are to repreſent them, be Beleevers, or have the ſame eſſentiall and internall Forme with thoſe, whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but that they have the externall <hi>confeſſion</hi> and <hi>profeſſion</hi> of their Faith, whereby they repreſent them; nor repreſent they their Faith, but their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith: So the Image of <hi>Caeſar</hi> repreſents really <hi>Caeſar,</hi> without any humane nature, ſuch as is in <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and ſo may men without Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them, that have Faith.</p>
               <p>By the word <hi>Church</hi> we muſt underſtand the <hi>Militant Chriſtian,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and <hi>reall Church,</hi> conſiſting of one Congregation; Theſe being preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, I put this Concluſion: All Perſons in a Church, or the whole Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Body thereof have not Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have not the power to exerciſe it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe, we read no ſuch thing in Scripture, viz. that ever God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Government of the Church to every idle Fellow, that is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe, it is contrary to the generall Ordinance of God, 1 Tim. 3. that all Church-Officers be examined and tryed before their Admiſſion; And to the practiſe of the Old Teſtament, in the religion of the Levites, that ſerved five yeares in their Apprenticeſhip.</item>
                  <item>3. Becauſe every particular member of the Church hath not the Ability to Iudge, or Rule, becauſe of his ignorance, and want of learning, for every one in the Church cannot be learned; for ſome there be that needs are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, ſome that be carnall; ſome Babes in Chriſt, ſome men: <hi>ſome have</hi> need of <hi>milke, ſome of meat,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3.</item>

                  <item>4. Becauſe of their imprudence, for ſome of the vulgar are ſomewhat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate and raſh in the examination of matters, others very ſlow in their judgement, ſome in their ſpeech, and ſome in all: which is not convenient in ſo grave matters, in Iudging the Iudgements of the Lord.</item>
                  <item>5. Becauſe ſome are vicious, and culpable of the faults, or crimes, that are to be Iudged and condemned in others, and therefore are not fit Iudges, to Iudge them.</item>
                  <item>6. Many in the Congregation may be friends, Kinſmen, or allyed with the party that is to be Iudged; and ſo partiall: wherefore ſome of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, at the leaſt in that caſe, are to be excluded: and by Conſequence, the ſimple Title of Chriſtianity, and profeſſion thereof, or to be a member of the Church, gives not all chriſtians this right, but ſome other thing.</item>
                  <item>7. If every one of the Church may Iudge, or exerciſe Eccleſiaſticall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, then women alſo, whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commands to hold their peace in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. and to be ſubject in obedience without Iuriſdiction.</item>
                  <item>8. All diſtracted men, and babes ſhould have power to Iudge; and ſo thoſe that are without Iudgment ſhold Iudge ſince they are members of the Church.</item>
               </list>
               <p>It may be anſwered, that they admit not babes, but thoſe only that are in age, and apparently regenerated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſt.</hi> But then every member of the Church hath power to Iudge; but men diſtracted are in age, <hi>Ergo</hi> they have power to Iudge. It may be anſwered, that they underſtand that thoſe only, that are in age, and have the uſe of reaſon ſhould be admitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſt.</hi> 1. But when hath a man the uſe of Reaſon? how ſhal they define that? It is commonly defined by Philoſophers and others, the age of ſeven yeares, which will make no very able Eceleſiaſticall Senator: here the Scripture is deſicient, &amp; they will admit nothing in Diſcipline, but that which is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Chriſt. 2. What if a man in his old age, begin to dote, they may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that then he is excluded becauſe reaſon failes him. <hi>Inſt.</hi> Then he muſt be declared not ſitting, which may breed diviſion. <hi>Jnſt.</hi> Item, a man may be in age, and yet little skilled in Divinity, for to Iudge in matter of Hereſie, and be more vitious then when he was a childe. And if a man be Iudged by babes, children, fooles, and doting old men, it is to be feared, eſpecially if the Iudged be rich, that the Iudgement be the cauſe rather of diviſion, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, ſo this Diſcipline being eſtabliſhed, all Schiſmes may break forth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and contentions. They may anſwer that they eſtabliſh, theſe that are really, or apparently in judgement of charity Saints, as it may be collected from the Rom. c. 1.2. 1 Cor. 1. Eph. 1. Phil. in the beginning of the chapters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> But every particular man, in every particular Congregation of the Viſible Church, whereof we only diſpute, is not, nor can in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king morally as falleth out ordinarily be a Saint; 1. Becauſe the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:121103:42"/>Church is compared to a Ground, whereof one part is by the way ſide, the other ſtony, another thorny, another good; To a Ground, wherin growes Wheat, and Tares; To a Draw-Net, receiving good and bad fiſhes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. to a Society of wiſe, and fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. And to a Houſe, wherein there are Veſſels to honour and diſhonour. There muſt be Offences, or ſlanders, ſaies Chriſt. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.7. 2. Howbeit they were all Saints, yet ſhould it not follow thereupon, that they are, all learned, prudent, judicious, and endowed with other gifts to judge, either in matters of Doctrine in Creating of Miniſters, and in Excommunicating of Hereticks; or of Diſcipline, which ſometime requires ſome knowledge of the Civill law, as in Caſes of Matrimonie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Paſſages of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> 1. I deny, that he calls all the Members of the Church, Saints Formally; but the whole Body of the Church is ſo called or denominated, becauſe of the holineſſe, which is really or apparently inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in ſome Members or parts thereof, which denominates the whole Body, as when a man is ſaid to ſee, becauſe of the ſight, which is not inherent in all the parts of his Body, but only in his Eye; or wiſe for his wiſdome, which is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in his Soule alone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it were otherwiſe, the Apoſtle ſhould have written untruths in theſe Texts: for <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17 18. he ſayes; <hi>Now I beſeech you, Brethren, marke them, which cauſe diviſions and offences,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For they that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly:</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. It is known, that the Ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous man was not excommunicated. Some of them were alſo Schiſmaticks, ſaying, that they were, of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Apolloes:</hi> And what the Galathians were, the whole Epiſtle teſtifies; ſo that according to our Brethrens grounds, there was no viſible Church here, and nothing could have been judged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not ſanctification, or holineſſe of life, but Politicall, or Eccleſiaſticall prudence, that furniſheth their Abilities: for 1. Sanctification is <hi>Gratia gratum faciens,</hi> one ſort of Grace or gift of the Spirit, that renders us gracious, or makes us acceptable to God: But the facultie of Ruling, and exerciſing of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in the Church, is <hi>Gratia gratis data,</hi> given gratiouſly only, but makes us not gracious or acceptable to God, as the Gift of Prophecie of Tongues, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepretation <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. The firſt is given us, principally for our own benefit: the other principally for other mens benefit: and therfore 3. the firſt is for to ſave a man himſelf: the ſecond to ſave others, when peradventure he may be damned himſelfe, as we ſee in <hi>Judas,</hi> who had the grace of Prophecie, whereby he ſaved others, but damned himſelfe, and did preach ſalvation to others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, but damnation to himſelfe unbeleeving. 4. The firſt makes one a good Chriſtian, the other a good Citizen in the exteriour Societie of the Church alone; yea, 5. I may boldly ſay, that a man may be a good Preacher, or Prophet, or Ruler in the Church, and an ill Chriſtian, if hee preach the truth, and with edification, or rule well, and beleeve not, which may
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:121103:43"/>bee done by a very wicked man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.19, 20, 21, 22, 23. and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other may be a good man, but an ill Preacher, Prophet, or Ruler, if he have ſanctifying grace, and have not ſo great abilities to preach, or to rule, as an other, who perchance is an Atheiſt; or if he be ſomewhat negligent in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his charge; The Apoſtle ſayes not that all, that were in their Churches were Saints either really or appearingly, but to all the Saints.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is probable alſo, and ſome of them grant it, that all the Members of the Church in thoſe texts of Scripture are called Saints, or holy. 1. becauſe of the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Covenant. 2. Or holy, becauſe of the holy Confeſſion. 3. Or holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. 4. Or of the holy Sacraments of the holy Covenant, wherunto they were partakers; or finally, becauſe of their externall Vocation to ſalvation: But all this makes them not learned, prudent, judicious, nor furniſhes them with other abilities, which are needfull for the exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But put the caſe that we ſhould grant them all this, yet can they not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape thus, ſaying that in ſo doing, they admit not all thoſe that are actually received in the Church, as her Children, and members, to the exerciſe of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Diſcipline, but the leſſer part, for there are more ignorant, then lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ill men, then good in the Church; or at leaſt, that have not the gifts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired therunto, and ſo in rejecting, they are forced to admit ſome Election, and eſtabliſh ſome repreſentative Church by the admiſſion of ſome, and the excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others; ſo that in this point they differ not from us, in not admitting a Repreſentative Church, but in admitting a greater and more Vaſt Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Church, then we; and the members thereof of leſſe Abilities.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence it follows, that men have not right to exerciſe Eccleſiaſticall Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in qualitie of Chriſtians profeſſing Chriſt (ſince women and others have it not) but in ſome other conſideration, which we deſire to know, <hi>viz.</hi> whether it be not for their Abilitie; and ſo it is not to be found in all.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This rejection of ſome (yea of the greater part of the Church, as women, children, old men, ignorants, Vitious men, and others that have not the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to judge, as all unholy and prophane men) and admiſſion of others, that are the leſſer part as ſanctified men, in whom only conſiſts the Church, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to breed Diviſions in their Church, if the people have power to judge; For, accordingly, they will judge in favour of themſelves to be admitted, and ſo procure a ſchiſme and quarrell; for the taking away whereof, the Government accordingly is eſtabliſhed, let them take it into conſideration, how hard it is for any man, yea for the moſt part of the Church, to be declared ignorant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, young, of an unripe judgement, and doting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to the Church, and ſee the leſſe part, which pretends to be the only Church, declared apt and fit to their owne excluſion, and what thereupon may enſue, in a Democraticall Government, upon ſuch filthy and infamous aſperſions; in checking the greater part as prophane, it may peradventure ſtirre up a <hi>bellum ſervile,</hi> more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the Church, then that amongſt the Romans.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:121103:43"/> 8. The Doctrine that deſtroyes Gods holy Ordinance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Diſtinction, which he has put betwixt the Rulers of the Church, and them that are ruled, and are to obey, cannot be admitted, as our Brethren will confeſſe.</p>
               <p>But the Doctrine that gives to every Member of the Church power and adminiſtration of Juriſdiction, in ruling and governing the Church, is ſuch; For God hath ordained ſome to rule, and others to obey, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. Heb. 13.17. <hi>Obey them, that rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, if ſome be Rulers, and others to obey, we cannot all be Rulers, as it appeares. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29. And God hath ſet ſome in the Church, Apoſtles, and Governments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are all Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Where he ſayes that one gift is not given to every Member of the Church, Note that he ſpeaks here of thoſe gifts, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that are called <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> not for our own, but for other mens uſe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> this order cannot be admitted.</p>
               <p n="9">9. No confuſed Diſcipline or government of Gods Church can be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God; for God is not the God of Confuſion. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33.</p>
               <p>But that wherein every one of the people hath Juriſdiction, or juridicall power, is a confuſed Diſcipline or government. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It cannot be ordained by God.</p>
               <p>The Major will be granted, ſince it is Gods word:</p>
               <p>The Minor is evident; For I put the caſe, that in a Church compoſed of ſome 20000 perſons, there be ſome point of Doctrine to be decided, what diſorder and confuſion ſhould it not breed, if every one of that huge multitude, yea, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry illiterate, and idle fellow ſhould come, and propound his idle thoughts? By what wiſdome of man could this many-headed beaſt be reduced to order?</p>
               <p>It may be anſwered, that they ſhould be wiſe;</p>
               <p>But we reply, they are not, nor can that be hoped, or expected in this life: nay, doe any beleeve it, either Donatiſts or Anabaptiſts; and howbeit they were all wiſe to ſalvation, yet followes it not, that they ſhould all be wiſe for Government, and Examination of all Church Officers.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The exerciſe of the Diſcipline of the Church is morally poſſible; for God will not that his Church be governed by an order that is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>But this Democraticall, and Plebeian exerciſe of Diſcipline, is not morally poſſible, for if there were 20. or 30. points to be judged by ſuch a huge multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude certainly they could not eaſily diſcuſſe, and judge every point. For if every one of 20000 ſhould give his adviſe, and peradventure be interrupted by ſome, and then begin his diſcourſe againe, which ordinarily falls out amongſt rude people, when ſhould the Examen and diſcuſſion of the buſineſſe be ended?

               <p>If the third way be uſed, then you muſt chooſe a certain number to ſpeak, whoſe voyces muſt be followed; and 1. that is no leſſe to tie them to an implicite Faith, then a Conſiſtorie does. 2. It is to diminiſh their power in ſpeaking; for their tongues are their own. 3. It is to contemne them, and judge, that ſome have more authority, then others. 4. What, if ſome of the people be of an other judgement then any of the reſt, how ſhall they diſcover it?</p>
               <p>The Suffrages cannot be given by little ſtones, or Ballots; for Writing cannot be uſed, becauſe many of the people cannot write; and yet all this would take up much time; and if there ſhould fall in many incidents, there ſhould never be an end.</p>

               <p n="11">11. Beſides this, the Diſcipline of the Church may be exerciſed in all times, yea, in times of Perſecution, as in the Primative Church.</p>
               <p>But this Democraticall ſort of Diſcipline cannot be exerciſed in all times, and ſpecially in time of Perſecution, which is moſt ordinary to the Militant Church; for if all the People ſhould ſo meet together, it could not be without great danger, under an Antichriſtian Prince; and principally in conſulting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her own conſervation, her Counſell might eaſily be diſcovered, and the Church of God betrayed by ſome mens wickedneſſe, and others folly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, whereas 10. or 12. or 50. of the moſt wiſe and prudent may eaſily meet together without any eminent danger.</p>

If a Congregation were great, as of 20000. or 30000. there could not be found a commodious Place to containe them; and this I ſay by experience, for being at one of their Conferences, there were ſo many, that we were like to be ſmothered.

Againe, I pray, Is it fit, that for all particular buſineſſes, peradventure ſome of them very idle, and of ſmall importance, that ſuch a great Congregation ſhould be gathered together, and taken away from their Callings; or that every particular fault ſhould be made known to every particular man in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? Should all the particularities; or circumſtances of moſt wicked and vile crimes, be examined, diſcuſſed, and voyced by ſo many of the people; what ſhould that be, but to teach them moſt execrable ſinnes, whereof they had never heard before; for it is certain, that many ſins are learned in hearing them. God forbid, that in the Chriſtian Church (wherein any Uncleanneſſe ſhould not be once named; <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,</hi> Eph. 4.29. <hi>Let not uncleanneſſe be once named amongſt you,</hi> Eph. 5.4. <hi>Neither filthineſſe,</hi> ver. 4.) Children in their tender age, ſhould heare of ſuch odious Sinnes, from which their very nature abhorres: And that young people before they know well what is vertue, ſhould heare all ſort of vice; That were worſe, then the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits Auricular Confeſſion, and abominable Caſes of Conſcience; In reading or hearing whereof the Conſcience is either offended, or infected.</p>
               <p>It may be anſwered, that it is not needfull to admit them in theſe Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> But the Aſſembly (ſay they) is open to all, to the end that all may learne, how to exerciſe the power of Eccleſiaſticall government: If it be open to all, how ſhall they be kept out? If to the end all may learne, how ſhall they obtain this end if they be kept out?</p>
               <p>It may yet be anſwered, that there is no leſſe publication of odious Sinnes, in white ſheets at the Pillar of Repentance in Scotland.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:121103:47"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> That paine is only inflicted on ſome ſins, 2. Neither are the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or circumſtances of the ſins, declared which ſhould be ſcandalous. 3. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the pain is publiſhed in generall, but the particularities, that may give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence are concealed.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In no Societie, neither in the Government of a Familie, nor of Schooles, or Academies, nor in Kingdoms, or Armies is it permitted to every man promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, without diſtinction, to judge and vote, but only to the Overſeers in their Societies: Wherefore then ſhould that be permitted, yea ordained in the Church of God, which is Gods houſe, Chriſts Schoole; Shall there be no place for fooliſh, and impertinent fellowes to judge in, but only in Gods houſe, and Kingdome, the holy City, and his Kingdome? For what inconvenience and Abſurdities preſſes the one, the ſame followes on the other.</p>
               <p>This Argument ſo propoſed <hi>ab Exemplo</hi> muſt hold, becauſe of the paritie of Reaſon in both.</p>
               <p>It may be propoſed in Forme of Syllogiſme thus:</p>
               <p>There is no Societie ruled by Law, wherein every man exerciſes the power of Judge.</p>
               <p>The Church of God is a Societie ruled by Law: <hi>E.</hi> In the Church of God every man cannot exerciſe the power of Judge.</p>
               <p>The Minor will be granted: The Major may be proved by Induction; for ſo is it not in Academies, Armies, Republicks, Kingdomes, <hi>&amp;c. E.</hi> It may be excepted that it is not ſo in the Church; But it is unreaſonable after a perfect Induction, and Enumeration of all other Societies, that you ſhould except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt that which is in queſtion: As if I ſhould goe about to prove that Chriſt, according to his humane nature had a Body, his due dimenſions, or qnantitie, becauſe all men have ſo; But you ſhould except Chriſt; for ſo no man can prove any thing; for evermore my Adverſary ſhall except that which is in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="15">15. If all the people promiſcuouſly may judge, then they may judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Presbyters, and Church-Officers.</p>
               <p>But the Conſequent is falſe. <hi>E.</hi> The Antecedent, from whence it is inferred, is falſe alſo.</p>
               <p>They will not deny the Aſſumption, and it may be proved thus; For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Paſtors, and Seniors, the Congregation cannot make a compleat Church, the People being but one halfe thereof, and their Rulers the other: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that there may be ſome Caſes, wherein the People cannot judge alone, as in point of Hereſie, and touching the capacitie of Miniſters, admitted to Preach.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence of the firſt Propoſition may be proved thus; For if they be all Judges; and of foure hundred or five hundred, foure or five, or fifteen chance to be abſent, the reſt may judge, the number of thoſe that are abſent; being no
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:121103:47"/>wayes conſiderable, in reſpect of that which is preſent; But ſo is the Caſe in the firſt Propoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> Becauſe, if of the people, two, three, or foure, yea 20.30. or 40. be abſent, the Church-Officers, with the reſt, will judge without them: Why ſhall not then the People have the ſame power alſo in abſence of the Church-Officers, fince they have all alike power to judge, <hi>viz.</hi> every man one voyce? This Argument ariſeth out of our Brethrens Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that every one has <hi>power</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. I Would willingly aske our Brethren, whether or no they thinke that an Eccleſiaſticall Judgement can hold without the Peoples preſence and voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? If it can hold, then the peoples voycing is not abſolutely needfull, nor <hi>ex inſtituto divino;</hi> For it cannot hold, nor be juſt, without that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to make it juſt.</p>
               <p>If it cannot hold without the Peoples voyces, I ask againe, whether all the peoples voyces be requiſite: or that the major part ſuffice.</p>
               <p>If all; it is impoſſible Morally; neither ſee we ever almoſt, that in a great Congregation all can meet together: or if they meet together, that all conſent together, yea, nor in leſſer Aſſemblies,</p>
               <p>If the major part ſuffice, as it muſt be ſaid, then can it not hold; for if many be abſent, and of thoſe that are preſent, the major part ſurmount the leſſer, by 4.5.6. or 7. voyces, then the leſſer part may complaine, that all the people were not preſent, and ſo deſire the buſineſſe to be remitted to another meeting; ſo that in concluſion no buſineſſe ſhould ever end, unleſſe all the people were preſent, which ordinarily never, or rarely falls out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> they fall into that very inconvenience, which they preſſe ſo hard againſt their Brethren, <hi>viz.</hi> that they that are abſent, ſhall be led by the noſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by an implicite Faith to a Judgement of Doctrine, or of Diſcipline of great conſequence, for other mens judgements ſake, whereunto Formally they diſſented; For if Judgements of Conſiſtories, compoſed of Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers alone cannot hold, becauſe then the People ſhould be led by the noſe, and aſſent thereunto by an implicite Faith: no more ſhould the Judgement of the People in this preſent Caſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame inconvenience, or worſe, ſhould fall out in voycing; for if there were in the Aſſembly of 20000. 10000. for one part, and the reſt for the other; Here all the reſt ſhould be led by one implicite Faith to conſent againſt their own explicite Faith; for here things are carried by pluralitie of voyces, which are not weighed, but accompted.</p>
               <p>If only the Maſters of Families, or all Servants have power to voyce, and if that may not procure partialities, when a Father may draw his ſons and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to his opinion, to voyce with him, as he will.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Beſides this, our Brethren muſt determine, how many they require to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:121103:48"/>accompliſh the Aſſembly, to the end that the Judgement may hold, and be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable. How many for the diſcuſſion and voycing of the buſineſſe? and after it is voyced, and judged, how many to draw up the Sentence, or Judgement; for in this all Nations doe not agree, neither one Senate in the Kingdome with another, in another Kingdome; nor one Senate in the ſame Kingdome with another; nor one Senate with it ſelfe in divers times. And if they determine it, we pray them to draw their Determination thereof out of Gods word, ſince they will admit of nothing concluded by naturall Reaſon, or drawn from the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p n="20">20. We may bring many more Reaſons to ſhew the impoſſibilitie, or at leaſt the very great difficultic, that is in this ſort of Judicatory, as the Caſe there ſhould fall in many incidents; as about refuſing of ſome of the Judges; ſome witneſſes; the Proteſtation of the nullity of the Judgement for ſundry Reaſons; that all the Judges were not well informed of the matter, ſome of them having given their Judgement before-hand, ſome having promiſed to the party to judge ſo or ſo, ſome of them having ſolicited others to judge ſo or ſo; if all theſe Incidents ſhould be diſcuſſed, and paſſe by the voyces of 20000. men, when ſhould it be ended?</p>
               <p>Wee might alſo bring other Reaſons, to ſhew how that ſundry things in this Government are altogether repugnant to Eccleſiaſticall Government, as</p>
               <p n="21">21. That a man ſhould be borne a Judge in Chriſts Church without any Election, or Vocation to ſuch a place; But <hi>no man taketh this honour unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron,</hi> Heb. 5.4. And truly there is no reaſon, that a man, yea that all men ſhould rather be borne Judges in Gods Church, then in the State.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The Hang-man, and the moſt ignominious perſons in the world ſhould be Judges here.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Nothing could ever be decided: for in caſe there were 5. or 6. divers Opinions, you could decide according to none: for if you followed that, which had moſt voyces with it, all the reſt would voyce againſt it, if that which had fewer, they that had more would not ſuffer it: ſo what ever ſhould be ſaid, or done, it ſhould be controlled.</p>
               <p n="24">24. We only adde Chriſts Command, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Tell it unto the Church.</hi> 1. Unto the Repreſentative Church, and not to every one of the People; for that ſhould be impoſſible. This paſſage our Brethren bring for them, but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it makes rather againſt them; for Chriſt here eſtabliſhing an Eccleſiaſticall Judicatorie, alludes to the order of the Jewes in their Synagogicall Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Sanedrim, in Cenſuring of Vice, and redreſſing of the grievances, that Brethren received of Brethren in the Church; for he aboliſhes not ſuch Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories, <hi>Quoad ſubſtantiam,</hi> ſince they are grounded on the Law of Nature, but <hi>quoad Circumſtantias,</hi> in ſo far as they are ordained by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> Captaine,

                  </gap>, as the Septuagint tranſlates it, gather unto me all the Elders of your Tribes, and Officers, and Deut. 23. v. 1, 2, 3. it is commanded, that he that is hurt by Burſting, or hath his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie members cut off; that is, a Baſtard, an Ammonite, or a Moabite, ſhall not enter into the Congregation, or <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> even to the Tenth Generation: Here <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> or Congregation cannot ſignifie the Reall, but the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Congregation; For it had been unjuſt, to exclude any man from the reall Church, &amp; conſequently from Gods Covenant, that deſired to be therein. If it had been ſo, they could not have received any Proſelytes, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is againſt Gods Law, Exod. 23.48. where it is commanded, to admit unto the Paſſeover all Strangers, that would be circumciſed: ſo that which was ſaid to the Elders of Iſrael, that were the Repreſentative Congregation, Exod. 2.16. is ſaid to have been ſaid to the Sons of Iſrael, that were the Reall Congregation, Exod. 14. and the Text confirmes it; for <hi>Moſes</hi> had not charge to ſay, that the Lord would bring up out of Affliction the Elders only, but alſo the People.</p>
               <p n="25">25. This Doctrine at once condemnes all the Martyrs, and Councells, and all their practiſe in Eccleſiaſticall Government.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Our Brethren holde, that the abſent part of the Church may give over, or remit their power of Iudging to them, that are preſent, and that the leſſer part are bound to acquieſce with the major part in voycing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then may not all the People give over, or remit their power of Iudging to a certaine number of the wiſeſt, ſuch as the Repreſentative Church is, or acquieſce unto their Iudgements?</p>
               <p n="27">27. To whom the Apoſtles, in the firſt Conſtitution of the Church, at their laſt Farewells committed the power of Iuriſdiction, and Ordination, to thoſe it is to be committed at this preſent.</p>
               <p>But to Church-Officers, or to the Repreſentative Body of the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, did the Apoſtles, in the firſt Conſtitution of the Church, at their laſt Farewell committed the power of Iuriſdiction, Ordination, &amp;c. Acts 20. 1 Pet. 5. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our Brethren reply, that we cannot ſhew any Place in all the holy Scriptures, or prophane Authors, where the word, Church, is taken in this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:121103:49"/>ſignification, viz. for the Repreſentative Church, or Congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whereunto we anſwer, 1. That the ſtile of Scripture muſt not be ſought in prophane Authors, but in Scripture it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some give ſome Examples in prophane Authors.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In Scripture our Adverſaries will never finde any place, wherein the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is taken for all the Reall Parochiall Church, to the excluſion of children, women, all thoſe that have not the uſe of Reaſon, and that are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly vicious, as it is taken by themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We on the other ſide, to confirme the ſignification, wherein it is taken by us, viz. for the Repreſentative Congregation, preſent them with theſe places, 1 Exod. 3. v. 14. Thus <hi>ſhalt thou ſay unto the children of Iſrael,</hi> i. e. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>repreſentative Body</hi> of the children of Iſrael, viz. <hi>the Elders of Iſrael</hi> gathered together, as it is expounded, v. 16.2. Exod. 12. In the inſtitution of the Paſſeover, v. 3. <hi>Speake yee unto all the Congregation of Iſrael,</hi> i. e. the Elders, which were the Repreſentative Body of Iſrael, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, v. 21. and Reaſon confirmes it; for they could not in ſo ſhort a time ſpeake to all the Reall Congregation, compoſed of ſo many thouſands; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they eaſily be gathered together into one place, nor could it be done without apparent danger.</p>
               <p>Item. Numb. 35.24. in ſpeaking of Murther through ignorance, the Revenger of the blood, and the Cities of Refuge, It is ſaid that the Congregation ſhall Iudge between the ſlaine, and the Revenger of Blood, according to thoſe Iudgements; without doubt the Congregation here cannot ſignifie all the Reall, but the Repreſentative Congregation; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Elders, 1.

               </p>
               <p>So it is ſaid, that <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſembled the Elders of Iſrael, and all the Heads of the Tribes, &amp;c. 1 Reg. 8.1.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>David</hi> aſſembled all the Princes, &amp;c. 1 Chro. 28.1. ſo the word Congregation, is taken for the Repreſentative Body thereof, 1 Chro. 13.1, 2, 3, 4 for <hi>David</hi> could not ſpeake to all the Congregation, but to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and Chieftaines thereof, as it appeares v. 1. and 4. 5. neither could they all goe with him.</p>
               <p>Deutrinomy, 23.1, 2, 3. It is commanded, that neither he who is burſten, or that hath his privie members cut off, or that is a Baſtard, an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monite,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:121103:49"/>or a Moabite, ſhall enter into the Congregation, or in <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the tenth Generation; here the word <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> or Congregation muſt not ſignifie the Reall, but the Repreſentative Congregation; for it ſhould have been unjuſt and cruell to have excluded from the Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from the Covenant of God any of thoſe, that deſired to be admitted thereunto. 2. For then they could not have received any of thoſe Nations for Proſelytes, to the tenth generation. 3.

               </p>
               <p>But the Conſequence is falſe, as is granted by all; neither can every one of the People aſſiſt and give their voyce touching every Almes, that muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Poore; yea it were very dangerous that every Poore man ſhould Iudge; for then all the Poore ſhould Iudge one for another, and hunt after the <hi>Deaconſhip,</hi> that they might keep the purſe, or give their adviſe upon every point of Doctrine taught, or to be taught; nor ſhould they then need to learne at the Sermons; And before the Paſtor ſhould teach the People, they muſt conſult whether his Doctrine be ſound, or not; As in <hi>governing,</hi> we conſult whether this, or that is to be <hi>done, cenſured,</hi> or not <hi>cenſured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29.

               </p>
               <p>They may anſwer, that Elders are needfull to debate things before they be propounded to the People; But that is only the duty of a Committee, and leſſe then to Iudge; and he who may have a deliberative and deciſive voyce may debate the matter; yea the matter being debated by the Elders, may be debated again amongſt the People; ſo that their Debate ſhould beſuperfluous.</p>

            <p>Acts 14.23. where Prieſts or Elders are ſaid to be choſen of the People, <hi>i.e.</hi> by the Peoples ſuffrages, ſignified by the ſtretching out of their hands.</p>

            <p>1 Cor. 5. and 2. Cor. 2. where the Inceſtuous perſon is excommunicated by the People, and admitted againe to the Communion by the ſame People.</p>
            <p>To all theſe I anſwer in order, and 1. To that of Mat. 18.17. <hi>Tel the Church, Ergo,</hi> all the People; I deny this Conſequence; for our Brethren them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at leaſt one great, or the greateſt part of them denies, that we ſhould delate every Offender to all the People, as 1, to women. 2. to children. 3. To diſtracted Perſons, howſoever they be members of the Church. 2. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they produce any Paſſage of Scripture, where the word <hi>Church</hi> is taken in this ſignification, viz. for the collective Body of the Church, to the excluſion of the greateſt part therof, viz. all women, children, diſtracted perſons, and vicious men, or notorious ſinners; But of this we have ſaid enough before.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond Paſſage, Act. 1.15.1. Put the caſe that the word, <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> ſignifie the promiſcuous multitude, yet 2. I anſwer, that it is not there ſaid, that every one of them gave their voyce, but only that-<hi>Peter</hi> ſtood up in the midſt of the Diſciples, the number whereof was about 120.3. If every one of them voyced; <hi>Ergo</hi> the women, and <hi>Mary,</hi> who are named, v. 14. voyced alſo, which is contrary to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> command, that women are to keep ſilence in the Church. 4. Only therefore thoſe did voyce, that had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to voyce, viz. Church-Officers, and not every one of the promiſcuous
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:121103:50"/>multitude, for the Reaſons already alleadged.</p>
            <p>And it may be confirmed, 5. becauſe it was not in the Peoples power to chooſe, or not to chooſe an Apoſtle; for he ſhewes from Pſal. 9. <hi>that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man muſt take his Biſhopricke,</hi> v. 20. Item, he binds them in another point, that <hi>ſome</hi> muſt be <hi>choſen of thoſe men,</hi> which had <hi>accompanied</hi> with the <hi>Apoſtles, all the time that the Lord Ieſus went in, and out among them, beginning from the Baptiſme</hi> of <hi>Iohn, unto the day he was taken up from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But wherefore then ſayes <hi>Peter,</hi> v. 22. <hi>One muſt be ordained?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To ſhew them, that <hi>neceſſitate Praecepti,</hi> of Gods command, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to accompliſh this Propheſie, Pſal. 9. ſome man muſt be put in <hi>Iudas</hi> his place: but hence it followes not, that he was to be choſen by the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But wherefore then ſayes the Text, that the <hi>People appointed two;</hi> viz. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Matthias?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Text ſaies not, that the <hi>People,</hi> but that <hi>they,</hi> viz. the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> and <hi>other Church-Officers,</hi> peradventure they that accompanied with <hi>them</hi> at the <hi>time, that the Lord Ieſus went in and out amongſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides this, it is not for us to anſwer all theſe Queſtions, or wherefore the Holy Ghoſt ſpeakes ſo, or ſo; It ſuffices us to beleeve that which is ſpoken; Theſe things are written, and ſaid, to the end that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them: It is our Brethrens part to prove from the Text, that which they ſay; otherwiſe we neither can, nor will beleeve them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To give them more ſatisfaction, and to anſwer ſundry other Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that may be propoſed, we diſtinguiſh in the <hi>Creation</hi> of a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> two <hi>things.</hi> 1. His <hi>Vocation</hi> to the <hi>Charge;</hi> 2. His <hi>Admiſſion</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>actuall Exerciſe</hi> thereof: The 1. containes, 1. the <hi>examen</hi> of his Life, 2. the <hi>examen</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 3. the <hi>act of Ordination,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, As for the firſt of theſe three, it may be done by the Paſtors and Ruling Elders, by power of Iuriſdiction, and by the People by way of Accuſation, in declaring to the Aſſembly of Paſtors, and other Church-Officers, what impediments they finde, if ſo be that the Perſon, that is to be created Paſtor, be of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſcandalous life. The ſecond belongs not to every one of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but only to Church-Officers, who are preſumed capable to judge of Doctrine, and of his ability for the Miniſtery. Now whether this belongs to Paſtors alone, or to the Ruling Elders alſo I will not diſpute: only they ſay, that they only can examine his Doctrine, that have the capacity to judge of it.</p>
            <p>To theſe two may be referred the voycing of his probitie, and capacity for his Doctrine, which belongs to the Paſtors and Elders, or to the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church; for howſoever the People may aſſiſt at the Action, to <hi>accuſe</hi> the perſon, that is to be received, of ill life, or falſe doctrine, or of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:121103:51"/>yet for the Reaſons above propoſed, they are not to be accepted in voycing either of his life, or Doctrine, but that belonging to the Paſtors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. and chap. 5. v. 11, 22.</p>
            <p>The third, viz. the right of <hi>Ordination,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſeemes only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Paſtors; neither doe our Brethren deny it; and it may be proved from 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Admiſſion,</hi> or Acceptation of a Miniſter into a particular Church, it belongs to the people, or to the whole Congregation; for as a Husband is not to be urged upon a woman againſt her will, but it being not <hi>Concubitus, conſenſus, qui facit matrimonium:</hi> no more is a Paſtor upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church; and howſoever he may goe to the Pulpit, and preach among them, yet unleſſe they <hi>conſent,</hi> he is not their Miniſter.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this to the preſent Paſſage, I ſay, that the <hi>examen</hi> of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> in this Election of <hi>Matthias,</hi> belonged to the Apoſtles, and other Church Officers, (whereunto might be admitted ſuch of the People as had the capacity) ſo did the Deliberative and the Deciſive voycing, as likewiſe the power of Ordination belonged to the Church-Officers alone; And yet the People were there. 1. to propound, if they knew any impediment againſt his <hi>Vocation.</hi> 2. to know that he was choſen. 3. to admit him as a Miniſter of the Univerſall Militant Church upon Earth; and in this they might voyce <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. by giving their conſent in ſtretching out their hands. Neither can they, or any man living draw any more from this Text: But note here, that the <hi>Vocation</hi> of a <hi>Miniſter, Eſſentially,</hi> and <hi>Formally</hi> conſiſts in the Deciſive voycing, and in his <hi>Ordination:</hi> The <hi>examen</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> are only <hi>Antecedents,</hi> and the <hi>Admiſſion</hi> of the people only Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of the Vocation; and ſo <hi>Accidentally</hi> it belongs to the People, but <hi>Eſſentially</hi> to <hi>Church-Officers only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, what if the Congregation will not admit the Miniſter, that is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I anſwer 1. That the Repreſentative Church ſhould not ordaine a Miniſter, till they be aſſured of ſome Flock, or Congregation, that will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him for their <hi>Miniſter.</hi> 2. That if after they have promiſed to admit him, they admit him not; they doe wrong to the Church: He is their true Paſtor, and they are to be commanded to <hi>admit</hi> him: even as a woman, that hath lawfully conſented to marriage, by her contracting of her ſelfe to ſuch a man. 3. If they will not obey, nevertheleſſe he is a Miniſter, yea, their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and hath power to teach, though he cannot exerciſe it for want of a Flock: But it concernes the Church to provide him of ſome Flock.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Others anſwer, that the People may have a hand in the Election of their Church-Officers in <hi>Eccleſia conſtituenda,</hi> ſuch as this was, but not in <hi>constituta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Paſſage which our Brethren bring out of Acts 6.2, 3. and 5, 6. prove
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:121103:51"/>not, That every one of the people had power of Iuriſdiction, and of the voycing in the Election of the ſeven Deacons, to the excluſion of children, yong men, men of weak Iudgement, notorious Sinners, and women; for the Text hath no ſuch thing in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be doubted, whether the multitude of the Diſciples, v. 2, 3. ſignifie the promiſcuous multitude, or the multitude of the ſeventy Diſciples, choſen by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe it ſignifie generally Chriſts Diſciples, and not preciſely thoſe ſeventy, yet it is not ſaid, that they created, or ordained the Elders.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The contrary may be concluded from the v. 4, 5. <hi>Then the Twelve called the multitude of the Diſciples unto them, and ſaid, Looke yee among you ſeven men of honeſt report,</hi> full <hi>of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>wiſedome,</hi> whom <hi>we</hi> may <hi>appoint over this Buſineſſe;</hi> where yee ſee, that the Apoſtles appointed their Deacons, and not the People; only the People ſought out thoſe ſeven men, as knowing better what kind of men were among them, then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; And they preſented them to the Apoſtles to be examined in their lives, and Doctrine before the Church-Officers, and to be ordained by them; So that the Apoſtles 1. ordained the Office. 2. commanded the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>ſeeke out</hi> honeſt Men. 3. <hi>examined</hi> them. 4. and <hi>appointed</hi> or <hi>ordained</hi> them, The people only had the power to <hi>inquire</hi> of their lives, and to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> or <hi>approve</hi> them by their conſent and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, v. 5. After that, They were ordained by the Church-Officers, that were preſent in the whole Action, and had ſeen all things paſſed without partiality, as I have above declared.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the People had had any voyce here, which cannot be collected out of this Text, yet it ſhould only follow, that they had this power in <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiâ conſtituendâ,</hi> but not in <hi>conſtitutâ, i. e.</hi> in the firſt Inſtitution of Churches, or Church-Officers: but not in a Church already eſtabliſhed, and furniſhed with all her ordinary Church-Officers, ſay others.</p>
            <p>The Place, Acts 14. verſe 22. whereon they inſiſt ſo much, hath <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>when they</hi> had <hi>ordained them Elders in every Church,</hi> Here they conceive, that the word, ſignifies to <hi>create Miniſters</hi> by <hi>Suffrages</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> who had voyce in the creating of Elders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To this ſome anſwer, and that very probably, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hath three divers ſignifications. 1. that it ſignifies the ſame, that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin word <hi>ſuffragari,</hi> or <hi>porrectis manibus ſuffiagia ferre,</hi> to give their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>lifting up,</hi> or ſtretching out their Hands. 2. to chooſe in any faſhion whatſomever, Acts 10. verſe 41.3. for the impoſition of Hands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and ſo it is taken in ſome of the Fathers Writings: ſo they ſay that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, here, may be taken either in the ſecond, or third ſignification, and that it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:121103:52"/>from the Text, that it is taken in the firſt: But they take that for granted, which they are not able to prove.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Put the caſe it ſignifie here to ordaine by the Conſent of the Peopte; yet followes it not, that this Conſent of the People was a Voyce, becauſe it was not asked of every man a part; neither hath the Text that; nor can it be ſought in great Congregations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Put the caſe; they had Voyce; yet followes it not, that they had voyce in the Examen, and Iudging of the Paſtors ſufficiency, ſince they had not the Iudgement, or ſufficiency themſelves to Iudge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but only, as I ſaid before, in the Examen of his life, if they knew any thing, that might hinder his Reception; or in the acceptation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a particular Church, or rejection from it, which only belonged to the Congregation, wherein he was to exerciſe his Office; which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And therefore as <hi>Tilenus</hi> obſerves in his Diſpute, <hi>De Vocatione Miniſtrorum,</hi> the Church of old times was wont to write in a Table, or Placard, in ſome publicke place, the name of him, who was deſtin'd to the Miniſtery: or in caſe that could not commodiouſly be done, they named him publickly in the Eccleſiaſtick Aſſembly, to the end that if any man knew any thing, which might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Reception, He might advertiſe the Church within ſuch a time, as Shee preſcribed for that purpoſe; And thus much we grant, and this Text proves no more.</p>
            <p>Our Brethren triumph much alſo of the Place, Acts 15. where they pretend, that in that famous Controverſie betwixt <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> on the one part; and ſome Phariſees on the other, about the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ceremoniall Law, and of Circumciſion, the People Iudged, and had voyce, as well as the Paſtors, and Elders, both at Antioch, and at Hieruſalem, which they prove; 1. becauſe v. 2. the Brethren deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſend <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to Hieruſalem, unto the Apoſtles, and Elders about that Queſtion.</p>
            <p>I anſwer 1. That the Text ſayes not, that the <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>People deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi> to ſend them; but that <hi>they determined;</hi> which, probably, were thoſe of the Repreſentative Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Put the caſe, that all the Church, and every member thereof <hi>determined</hi> to ſend them: yet could they not <hi>determine</hi> that, but as they could, viz. the Repreſentative Church, compoſed of Church-Officers, by power of Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in <hi>voycing,</hi> and giving of Iudgement; And the People by <hi>conſenting</hi> to their juſt <hi>Iudgement</hi> explicitely, or implicitely.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may be, that the Church was divided into two Factions of equall force, which made a great Schiſme; for the Text ſayes, v. 2. that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had no ſmall diſſention with the Phariſees; and in ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary caſe the Conſent of the people might well have been ſought: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:121103:52"/>the Text ſayes it not. 4. But, howbeit it were ſo; Extraordinary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are not to be drawn into conſequence. 5. Howbeit, the People had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; yet did they it not in an Eccleſiaſticall, but in a Politicall way, <hi>viz.</hi> in furniſhing them their Charges, and in that they might have Voyce or Power to conſent, or give ſuffrage in furniſhing money, which was accidentall to this Eccleſiaſticall and Spirituall Power. 6. To ſend Deputies, or the parties to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> or to a Synod, to debate the queſtion, is not a proper act of Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction: but the <hi>Voycing,</hi> and <hi>Pronouncing</hi> of <hi>Sentence</hi> in Eccleſiaſticall Cauſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They prove it from this Text; becauſe, they were <hi>brought on their way by the Church. E.</hi> What follows? That every one of the People in the Church, except Women, Children, Diſtracted men, and Sinners had Voyce in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. I deny the Conſequence; for how know they, that there were no VVomen, nor Youths, that brought them on their way? 2. How know they, that all the Reall Church brought them on their way? 3. To bring them <hi>on their way,</hi> is not an Act of Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction, but of Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or of Civill Humanitie; Neither belongeth it to every one, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyes a Commiſſioner a part of <hi>his way,</hi> to have a Deciſive <hi>Voyce</hi> in that, which his Commiſſion containes. Truly, This is ſo ridiculous, that I am aſhamed to anſwer it, or that the world ſhould believe, that ſo good and ſo learned men, ſhould be moved to make a Schiſme in the Church of God, for ſo frivolous Arguments.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They prove it from the fourth verſe, becauſe, they were received of the Church, and of the Apoſtles and Elders. <hi>E.</hi> Every one in the Church had power of Voycing, and of Juriſdiction, except Women, Children, and Sinners.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. I deny the Conſequence; For he who receives a Commiſſioner, or a party hath not evermore Power, to heare his Commiſſion, much leſſe to judge thereof, as we ſee in State-Buſineſſes.</item>
               <item>2. The Text ſayes not, that they were received by all the Reall Church, excepting Women, Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <item>3. Neither ſayes the Text, that they that received them, received them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly in the Peoples name.</item>

Or, that they were received by them, in qualitie of Church-Commiſſioners from <hi>Antioch.</hi> But rather in qualitie of Apoſtles, by Apoſtles, by whom God had done great wonders in the Converſion of the Gentiles, as it may be concluded, from the 3. and 4. verſes; For in declaring this, <hi>they rejoyced.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That Caſe is extraordinary, in reſpect of the order eſtabliſhed in Gods Church; for when it is ſaid, <hi>Tell it unto the Church: and if hee heare not the Church, &amp;c.</hi> It is ſuppoſed, that the Church will judge the judgements of the Lord, or according to his Law; neither hath Shee any other order from God, but in that extraordinarie Caſe ſuppoſed. I anſwer, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the People, nor any particular man is bound to obey the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative Church, but every one hath power of God, to conteſt lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Judgement of the Repreſentative Church, and Shee is bound to admit them in their conteſtations, and to heare them according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to amend their Judgement: And if all the Church, or the greater part of the Reall Church, or Congregation oppoſe it ſelfe to their Judgement, it cannot ſtand, nor be put in execution; yea, I dare ſay, that the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, ſhewing her ſelfe pertinacious in her errour, after ſufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, or refuſing to heare her conviction, is really Schiſmaticall, or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall (according to the matter conteſted) in Gods account; And howſoever particular men cannot right themſelves, but are bound to ſuffer injuſtice, ſo long as they ſtay in ſuch Churches (ſince they are not Eccleſiaſticall Judges;) or to retire themſelves out of the ſocietie of ſuch Oppreſſors, to the end they may more eaſily defend themſelves: nevertheleſſe the Collective Body of the Reall Church, or the greater part thereof, if it have the Abilitie, is bound to refute them, to make them aſhamed, yea, to contemne their Judgement, and by all lawfull meanes, oppreſſe ſuch Oppreſſors: And this is the Doctrine of our firſt Reformers, oppreſſed by the Roman Antichriſtianiſme, againſt Papiſts, which holds alſo in Reformed Churches; For it is all one to me, to find Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Tyranny at <hi>Rome,</hi> or at <hi>Edinburgh, London, Paris,</hi> or <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> It is not the place, but Antichriſtian Tyranny, or Doctrine, that makes an Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>And to be quit with them here, I aske againe, what if the Judgement of the Conſiſtorie be right, and that of the People, which ordinarily falls out, wrong: or if the Judgement of the greater part of the People be wrong, and that of the leſſer part right: what then is to be done or followed? Here they ſhall find themſelves in no leſſe ſtraights, then they think to draw us unto.</p>

            <p> 
               <hi>A.</hi> They, that ſay ſo, have not ſeen nor heard much of that which paſſes in the Chriſtian world: it is a thing very ordinary, to ſee ſome civill Cauſes, in civill Judicatories Pleaded with the doors ſhut, by the conſent of the Parties: yea ſometimes, by the will of the Judges. 2. And I would pray them (to go no farther) to tell me, if every man hath libertie to enter in at the Parliament, here at home. They cannot deny, but that the door is kept cloſe, and that ordinarily, only the Members of the Houſe have entry.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And nevertheleſſe; if the Parties deſire to plead their Cauſes in the preſence of ſo many as may enter, I doubt not but the Reformed Church will grant it them; yea, there is an Act of the French Diſcipline to that purpoſe; command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Parties deſiring their Cauſes to be diſcuſſed openly, the doores caſt open, it ſhould be granted.</p>
            <p>Yea, wee maintain; that in ſuch Caſes, when parties complaine of ſuch ſecret Eccleſiaſticall oppreſſion, the Church is bound by law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to proceed publickly, and to juſtifie to the world her Proceedings; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſhee is no wayes to be believed.</p>
            <p>And this Argument I had willingly paſſed over, if it had not been urged againſt me; and that I had beene prayed to anſwer it by ſome of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that thought it ſo ſtrong, that it could not be anſwered.</p>
            <p>But to anſwer <hi>ad hominem;</hi> may not ſuch faults fall out amongſt them that object this Argument, as we have Examples of it? Our Queſtion is not ſo much what is done, as what ſhould be done; How to eſtabliſh a Law againſt Abuſes in the Churches, and not, How men abuſe their owne Authoritie.</p>
